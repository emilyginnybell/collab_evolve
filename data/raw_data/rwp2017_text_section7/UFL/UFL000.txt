Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices
This section presents the Upper Flint Water Planning Council’s roadmap for the
implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6. It details
schedules for implementation, responsible parties, and cost estimates for
implementation. It also describes the alignment of this Regional Water Plan with
other plans that address or relate to water resources in this water planning region. It
ends with recommendations from the Council related to information needed to
improve future planning and water policy changes that would facilitate attainment of
the Council’s vision and goals for the Upper Flint Water Planning Region.
The availability of funding is a critical determinant in the ability of the responsible
parties to successfully implement the management practices identified in this Plan. In
general, sources of funding for individuals, such as farmers, include investment by
these individuals and grant and incentive programs. Sources of funding for
implementing management practices at the local government or utility level include
revenues generated by water and wastewater providers, local government general
funds raised through property taxes, and service fees charged by local governments
to citizens. Local governments and utilities can also apply for loans and grants to
finance implementation. Affected authorities and individuals in this water planning
region will be responsible for determining the best method for funding and
implementing applicable management practices.
7.1 Implementation Schedule and Responsible Parties
Table 7-1 details actions, identifies responsible parties, and provides timeframes for
implementation of the management practices in Table 6-1. Short-term practices are
those which will be implemented or encouraged over the five-year timeframe leading
up to the next update of this Plan. Long-term management practices vary in duration
and scope and will require further study and development to define time
requirements. As noted in Section 6, the Council selected these management
practices to apply to the whole Upper Flint Water Planning Region. Although the
region’s boundaries encompass multiple surface water and groundwater resources,
the Council believes that the management practices will benefit all water resources in
the water planning region.
SUMMARY: This section presents the Upper Flint Water Planning Council’s
roadmap for the implementation of the water management practices identified in
Section 6. Implementation actions and responsible parties are described, and
schedules and costs are specified, where appropriate. The Council’s research and
policy recommendations are also included in this section.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans
The development of this Plan by the Upper Flint Water Planning Council builds upon
a knowledge base developed in previous planning efforts by state and local
governments and authorities. In the last planning cycle, the Upper Flint Water
Planning Council conducted a comprehensive review of existing local and regional
plans and relevant related documents that concern water resources to frame the
selection of management practices. A supplemental document entitled Existing
Regulatory and Local Plan Summary (2011) summarizes this effort; it is available on
the Council’s website. The Council considered known plan updates in the review and
revision process for this Plan.
The Council also ensured alignment with other Regional Water Plans by coordinating
with neighboring water planning councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District. The Council participated in a joint meeting with several other water
planning councils, including the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, Middle Chattahoochee,
and Coosa-North Georgia Water Planning Councils and the Metropolitan North
Georgia Water Planning District. In this meeting, council members discussed shared
issues relating to resource availability and quality and policy, regulatory, and funding
issues.
The Upper Flint Water Planning Council included joint recommendations with the
Lower Flint-Ochlockonee and Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Councils in its
2011 plan, and this revised plan updates the joint recommendations (see Section
7.4). The Council coordinated with these neighboring water planning councils with
the support of the planning contractor to align the joint recommendations.
Additionally, the Council reviewed the draft water resources plan of the Metropolitan
North Georgia Water Planning District and submitted comments to the District on the
draft plan. The Council’s water planning region also includes a small part of the
Suwannee River Basin, and therefore, the planning contractor supported the council

7. Implementing Water Management Practices
UPPER FLINT
in reviewing the Satilla-Suwannee Water Planning Council’s plan to ensure plan
alignment for shared resources. Through these efforts, the Council has coordinated
its Plan with the plans of neighboring water planning councils and the Metropolitan
North Georgia Water Planning District. No conflicts with these other regional water
plans have been identified.
Alignment with the existing Flint River Basin Regional Water Development and
Conservation Plan (2006) was considered by the Council. While the Council’s
recommendations improve upon the 2006 plan, none of its recommendations conflict
with that plan.1
7.4 Recommendations to the State
The Upper Flint Water Planning Council has identified several recommended actions
that would improve water resource management and planning in this water planning
region and the State as a whole.
Information Needs
Addressing the following information needs would support improved water resources
management and future water planning. Implementation of research and
assessments to fill these information needs will require funding (state, federal, other).
Implementing agencies are not indicated here; if funding is identified, qualified
researchers from state universities, institutions, and agencies, as well as private
sector firms, can fulfill these information needs. As new information becomes
available, it should be incorporated into future cycles of the regional water planning
process, and the resource assessment models should be modified to reflect up-todate
information as it is developed.
· Improve resource assessment models used in the regional water planning
process through increased use of actual water use and resource
conditions data. The incorporation of agricultural water meter data in the
forecasts and resource assessments was a notable improvement in this
planning cycle. The Upper Flint Water Planning Council urges continued
adoption of actual data, where possible. The Council recommends
expanded use of data collected by local governments and water and
wastewater systems in the region in the forecasts and resource
assessments.
· Evaluate the potential environmental and other impacts of low flow
conditions seen in model results at the Bainbridge planning node;

available on the EPD website: http://www1.gadnr.org/frbp/index.html.

7. Implementing Water Management Practices
UPPER FLINT
determine low flow thresholds below which adverse ecosystem impacts
are predicted.
· Evaluate additional low-flow statistics for use in surface water availability
resource assessment. In addition to monthly 7Q10, consider use of the
following metrics to improve understanding of instream flows: 20% AAD;
stratified 7Q10 (e.g. prior to 1975); one-day minima; 3Q30; or other
relevant approaches.
· Improve estimates and forecasts of water use by the energy sector to
support regional water planning in Georgia. The EPD developed energy
water use forecasts for the 2011 and 2017 planning cycles, but this
forecasting did not identify geographically specific water needs. Energy
water use forecasting should also account for greater cooling tower
efficiencies, energy conservation, future increases in power production,
water quality, and other factors, as appropriate.
· Increase the number of surface water availability model planning nodes
(used as evaluation points) in the Flint River Basin to support more
detailed geographic understanding of water resource conditions. The
addition of the planning node at Carsonville in this planning cycle
provides valuable information to support the resource assessment. To
support more refined analysis of the potential gap seen in the model at
Bainbridge, the Council recommends the addition of a new planning node
between Montezuma and Bainbridge on the Flint River.
· The three states (Georgia, Florida and Alabama) and the USACE should
cooperatively review and update the Unimpaired Flows dataset for the
ACF System. Where technically feasible, refinement of the Unimpaired
Flows dataset should include impacts from land use change as well as
water withdrawals, returns, net evaporation or other human influences.
· Improve assessment of groundwater use and recharge to support better
understanding of impacts of use on aquifers and streamflow and to
support protection for aquifer recharge areas. The Upper Flint Water
Planning Council recognizes improvements in this planning cycle to
assess groundwater availability, and it urges continued efforts to improve
our understanding of aquifer health. In particular, very little information is
available to the Council on aquifer recharge areas. This information would
support planning for enhanced aquifer protection.
· Evaluate the costs and benefits of reducing the minimum threshold at
which permits are required for water withdrawals (surface water and
groundwater).
· Complete a comprehensive assessment of baseline implementation of
water conservation and water quality Best Management Practices by
agricultural producers. The Council recognizes that state and federal
agencies have existing programs that measure BMP implementation, but

at this time, a comprehensive baseline assessment is lacking. Recent
efforts to conduct field verification of conservation equipment adoption by
farmers in the Lower Flint River Basin have initiated development of a
baseline dataset. The Council recommends that this survey be expanded
to include the entire Flint River Basin. A comprehensive field survey of
BMP implementation, for conservation and water quality practices would
support estimation of potential benefits of future implementation, tracking
of implementation progress, and BMP prioritization. The survey
periodically conducted by the Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC) on
BMP implementation is a model for a program to address this information
need.2
· Evaluate the full water cycle impacts of irrigation and evaporative losses
from reservoirs to support better understanding of these factors in water
resource planning.
· Improve implementation of the agricultural water withdrawal metering
program of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division by:
o Completing comprehensive installation of meters
o Ensuring the meters are functioning properly through regular
maintenance inspection
o Increasing data collection on parameters including monthly use,
crops, inputs
o Continuing to report aggregate results annually to permittees and
policymakers
o Continuing to prepare collected data in a manner that will facilitate
use in future resource assessments
2 Water quality programs for nonpoint source management in the forestry industry are a potential model for other
sectors. Georgia’s Best Management Practices for Forestry (http://www.gatrees.org/forest-management/waterquality/
bmps/BMPManualGA0609.pdf) describes benchmark BMP guidelines for Streamside Management Zones,
Forest Roads, Stream Crossings, Timber Harvesting, Site Preparation, Reforestation and all other forestry related
practices. The Georgia Forestry Commission conducts a biennial statewide BMP implementation survey in
accordance with the Southern Group of State Foresters protocol. Randomly selected forestry operations are selected
statewide and evaluated for appropriate BMP implementation. In 2015, the GFC evaluated 213 sites totaling 32,932
acres statewide. Forestry BMPs were properly implemented at a rate of 91.2%. In the Upper Flint Water Planning
Region, 14 sites were evaluated, and a 95.2% implementation rate was observed. The GFC investigates forest water
quality complaints and works with landowners, timber buyers and loggers to correct any issues of non-compliance
with forestry BMPs. In calendar year 2016, complaint cases investigated by the GFC resulted in a 15% increase in
the BMP implementation with a final overall average implementation of 95.6%. A total of 28 water quality risks were
initially identified and 100% eliminated due to GFC involvement. In cases where the GFC cannot get satisfactory
compliance, the case is turned over to EPD for enforcement. GFCs forestry BMP monitoring is documented and
provided to the forest industry as an update on current BMP compliance. GFC’s Forest Water Quality Program
accomplishments are reported to EPD quarterly.

· Evaluate implementation and effectiveness of water conservation
practices. Water conservation is a priority focus of the management
practices in this plan, but there are currently several practical limitations
to measuring progress and impact in conservation implementation, such
as inconsistent terminology, lack of available data, and the need to
identify practical ways of collecting data. Periodically, it will be important
to assess the progress and benefit of the water conservation program.
· Evaluate the impacts of small and medium impoundments on stream
flows through intercepted drainage, evaporative loss, and water quality.
More information on the potential for evaporative loss is needed to assess
the impacts of these impoundments.
· Continue to improve how farm pond withdrawals are incorporated into the
resource assessment models.
· Evaluate the use designations assigned to stream reaches in the Upper
Flint Water Planning Region as a part of the Triennial Review of Georgia
Water Quality Standards. This review is intended to ensure that water
quality performance criteria reflect actual conditions, in terms of both use
and quality.
Water Policy Recommendations
In the following recommendations, the Upper Flint Water Planning Council urges the
Georgia General Assembly and other policymakers in Georgia (e.g., Board of Natural
Resources) to pursue actions to improve water resource management in the state
and in the Upper Flint Water Planning Region.
· The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly provide
funding for continued planning by the regional water planning councils, as
described in Section 14 of the State Water Plan, in order to ensure
continued progress toward the vision and goals of the state and regional
water plans. The Council also recommends that the General Assembly
provide funding to support monitoring of plan implementation, data
collection to support future planning by the regional water planning
councils, and continued refinement of water resource assessments used
in the development of Regional Water Plans.
· The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly and
implementing agencies, such as EPD, explore all possible funding
sources to offset or pay for many of the management practices outlined in
this Plan. The Council emphasizes that funding for plan implementation is
the Council’s highest priority. Financial incentives and reimbursement for
implementation of practices will expedite the progress needed to achieve
the goals of this Plan.

UPPER FLINT
· The Council recommends that EPD and other agencies with water policy
responsibilities should design water conservation policy and regulations
to recognize and credit water users for conservation practices that they
have already implemented. Conservation policies and regulations should
prioritize addressing consumptive over nonconsumptive uses.
Additionally, conservation policy and regulations should be designed with
an emphasis on cost-effectiveness as a key criterion.
· The Council urges the Georgia General Assembly and other state
policymakers not to preclude interbasin transfer (IBT) as an option for
future water management in the region, as needed and following
thorough scientific and economic evaluation. Interbasin transfers of water
exist in many places in Georgia at this time. The Council recognizes that
interbasin transfers (existing or future) can play an important role in water
resource management. Interbasin transfers of water can provide supply
or flows to a receiving basin where water is needed. Rules adopted by the
Georgia Board of Natural Resources in January 2011 will help to ensure
that future permits for interbasin transfers are thoroughly evaluated.3 The
Council also supports the evaluation of the feasibility of reversing existing
IBT's in the Flint River Basin and returning water to the region's surface
waters. On a case by case basis, additional scientific research is
necessary to determine the costs and effects to water and wastewater
service providers for modifying facilities, estimate the return flow benefit
to the basin of origin, and identify sources for funding to reverse IBT's. An
example of such research is available in a report prepared for the City of
Griffin by the Paragon Consulting Group (Technical Memorandum: Flint
River Basin/Ocmulgee River Basin Interbasin Transfer Analysis, 2016).
This report estimates the costs and flow benefits for IBT reversal for the
City of Griffin’s utilities.4
· The Council recommends that irrigation suspension be used only through
implementation of the Flint River Drought Protection Act, only by
voluntary means, with notification to farmers before March 1 when
possible, and only as a last resort when other options are not available to
address severe flow depletions. The Council supports voluntary
implementation of the Flint River Drought Protection Act (OCGA §12-5-
40) by EPD through an irrigation suspension auction, when absolutely
necessary in abnormally dry periods and when other options are not
available to address severe flow depletions. When possible, EPD should
3 See DNR Rules Chapter 391-3-6-.07.

approximately $6 million and provide a return flow benefit of approximately 0.75 mgd.

UPPER FLINT
provide notification of use of the Flint River Drought Protection Act before
the March 1 drought declaration deadline. Earlier notification to farmers
would inform planting decisions and help reduce the cost to farmers and
to the state for irrigation suspension. The Council acknowledges efforts to
improve drought prediction tools to support earlier notification and
supports EPD efforts to develop better predictive tools. The Flint River
Drought Protection Act has not had a predictable source of funding in
recent years, and a clear and reliable source of funding is needed. The
Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly should clarify
the regulatory definition of stream buffers to ensure consistent application
throughout the State (see management practice WQ-3).
· The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly legislate
authority to the regional water planning councils, including the Upper Flint
Water Planning Council, to manage, plan and provide oversight of water
resources within each region around the State. Funding should be
provided to the councils from State appropriations. Funding should be
used to provide for coordination and implementation of regional and state
water plans and for studies, assessments and future plan updates within
the respective water planning regions.
· The Council urges the State to seek a timely resolution of current
interstate water issues that directly affect the Apalachicola-
Chattahoochee-Flint Basin. The Council recommends the development of
a tristate framework designed to address interstate water issues in the
future and the inclusion of the regional water planning councils within this
framework. The Council requests that it be supported in making any
updates to this Regional Water Plan as needed to address changes in
ACF Basin management as a result of the settlement, resolution, or
decision in on-going inter-state litigation or similar events that have the
potential to substantially change how the Basin is managed.
· The Council recommends continued coordination and cooperation among
neighboring water planning councils. The Upper Flint Water Planning
Council has worked closely with the Middle Chattahoochee and Lower
Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Councils and the Metropolitan North
Georgia Water Planning District. Our joint efforts will benefit our regions
and the State as a whole.
Coordinated Recommendations with Neighboring Councils
Since the beginning of regional water planning in Georgia in 2009, the Upper Flint
Water Planning Council has met several times with neighboring regional water
planning councils to discuss shared water resources and topics of concern. The
Upper Flint Water Planning Council met several times with the Lower Flint-
Ochlockonee and Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Councils and developed a

UPPER FLINT
collaboration with these councils that led to their agreement on a set of joint
recommendations in 2011. In this planning cycle, the three councils reviewed and
revised their joint recommendations. The following joint recommendations were
approved by all three councils in 2017. The agreement among these councils on
these recommendations indicates the importance of these recommendations to the
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin, of which all three councils are a part, and to
the State as a whole.
These joint recommendations overlap with some of the Upper Flint Water Planning
Council’s management practices and recommendations. Where overlap does occur,
the Council does not see any conflict; the Council’s management practices and
recommendations generally provide more detail than the joint recommendations. In
all cases, the Council’s Regional Water Plan takes precedence over the joint
recommendations.
The Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Middle Chattahoochee Water
Planning Councils:
· Recognize the critical need for better use of existing storage and for more
storage in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint System and recommend
that a plan for additional storage be developed and implemented and that
it consider the following: better utilization of existing storage in the
Chattahoochee River Basin, new storage in the Flint River Basin, and
enhancement of existing storage capacity.
· Urge EPD and those involved in the resource assessment modeling to
improve upon existing models for future regional water planning by further
expanding use of actual and current data on water use and conditions
and continuing to refine modeling assumptions to more closely
approximate actual conditions.
· Consider the creation of a new coordinated, interstate planning
organization for the ACF System. Membership in this organization to
represent Georgia shall include, but not be limited to, members of the
regional water planning councils with water planning regions that include
parts of the ACF. Consider the recommendation of the ACF Stakeholders
in its Sustainable Water Management Plan regarding an ACF
transboundary water management institution as this organization is
developed
