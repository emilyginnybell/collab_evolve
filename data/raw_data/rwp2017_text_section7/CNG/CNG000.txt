Section 7. Implementing
Water Management
Practices
This section presents the CNG Regional Water
Planning Council’s roadmap for implementing the
water management practices identified in
Section 6. Updates to the implementation
schedule reflect the changes in the recommended
management practices and feedback from the
Council on the original schedule of activities. The
Regional Water Plan will be primarily
implemented by the various water users in the
CNG Region along with the other responsible
parties described below.
The Regional Water Plan is used to:
• Guide permitting decisions by GAEPD.
• Guide the awarding of Section 319(h)
Nonpoint Source Implementation Grant funds from GAEPD.
• Guide the awarding of State grants and loans for water-related projects.
7.1 Implementation Status
In 2015, the Northwest Georgia Regional Commission (NWGRC) assisted the CNG
Regional Water Planning Council in development of a progress report to document the
status of implementation activities across the Region and to evaluate potential
changes to the management practices (Section 6) and the implementation schedule
(Section 7) (NWGRC, 2015). Over the first 5 years of plan implementation, members
of the CNG Council participated in monthly meetings with the North Georgia Water
Resources Partnership (Partnership) to discuss implementation status of the ongoing
technical studies funded by the Partnership and grants from GAEPD. Although not
“official” Council meetings, these meetings served as opportunities to coordinate
between local governments within the Region on key technical issues related to plan
implementation.
The primary studies that have been either funded by the Partnership or GAEPD grants
since 2011 include the following:
• Nutrient Trading – Nutrient Trading in the Coosa Basin: A Feasibility Study was
completed by Brown and Caldwell in August 2013 and was funded by an EPA
319 (h) grant. The study evaluated the issues associated with setting up a point to
nonpoint source nutrient trading framework. The study was conducted in an effortto reduce total phosphorus loads by 30 percent in the Coosa River, measured at
the Georgia/Alabama state line, as required by the EPA’s Lake Weiss TMDL for
Nutrient Impairment (2008).
• Redundancy and Emergency Interconnectivity Study – The Redundancy and
Emergency Interconnectivity Study was completed by Jacobs and Amec Foster
Wheeler in April 2015 and was funded by a Regional Water Plan Seed Grant from
GAEPD. The study evaluated the feasibility for using municipal water system
interconnections for emergency water supply.
• Water Transmission Grid Study – The Water Transmission Grid Study was
completed by Jacobs and Amec Foster Wheeler in April 2015 and was funded by
a Regional Water Plan Seed Grant from GAEPD. This is a long-term planning
study that evaluates the potential for developing a regional water transmission grid
across multiple municipalities to meet future water demand beyond the year 2050.
The document’s high level plan for meeting water supply needs is intended to
encourage water systems and stakeholders to consider regional implications when
making local decisions.
• North Georgia Agricultural Water Use Study – The North Georgia Agricultural
Water Use Study was completed by TetraTech in June 2015 and was funded by a
Regional Water Plan Seed Grant from GAEPD. The study determines the amounts
of agricultural water use in the CNG Region. Agricultural acreage and irrigation
withdrawal data were used to estimate water use. These data came from a variety
of sources, including the UGA Center for Agribusiness and Economic
Development, the Natural Resources Spatial Analyst Laboratory, and GAEPD,
among others. Water use was estimated for commercial crops, poultry, and
livestock.
• Soque River Nutrient Management Study – The Partnership, NWGRC, Cities of
Cornelia and Clarksville, and the Soque River Watershed Association are
collaborating on a nutrient study to identify nutrient sources in the watershed and
potential strategies for nutrient loading reductions in the future. Findings from this
study will be used to improve water quality management practices around the
Region in the future.
In 2014, the Partnership entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with
the Georgia Association of Water Professionals (GAWP) to allow for collaboration and
development of educational and resource materials to facilitate implementation of the
Regional Water Plan. Through this partnership, the following resource documents
were identified, and can be accessed through the GAWP website, www.gawp.org.
• Best Practice Master Planning Guidance and Resource Document
• A Guide to Asset Management for Small Water Systems
• Stormwater Program Guidance Manual for Small Local GovernmentsBetween April and September 2015, the NWGRC held a series of three council
meetings to review implementation status of the original plan and to evaluate potential
changes to the recommended management practices.
7.2 Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible
Parties
Tables 7-1(a) through 7-1(d) identify the short- and long-term actions needed to
implement the management practices detailed in Tables 6-1(a) through 6-1(d) and the
corresponding responsible parties for each series of actions. The Council has defined
short-term as occurring between 2018 and 2022 and long-term as year 2022 and
beyond. It is assumed that all long-term activities would occur after the next 5-year
Regional Water Plan update, allowing the Council to revisit these actions using an
adaptive management approach. Based on Council feedback, the RCs will take the
lead role in coordinating and assisting local governments and utilities in implementing
the management practices.
While the bulk of implementation actions noted in this section fall to local governments
and utilities and their corresponding RCs, support for implementation will be needed
from State entities such as GAEPD, DCA, Georgia Department of Community Health
(DCH), Division of Public Health, Environmental Health Section, and Georgia
Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA). This Regional Water Plan also assumes
continued support from the Council in some capacity beyond its current 3-year
appointment. Support from other organizations, such as the Association of County
Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG), Georgia Green Industry (GGIA), Georgia
Municipal Association (GMA), Georgia Rural Water Association (GRWA), and Georgia
Association of Water Professionals (GAWP) also will be needed to implement the
management practices in an efficient, cost-effective manner. In the CNG region, the
Partnership has been a key partner in providing technical support for implementation
of the regional water plan and will continue to serve in this role in the future.
Tables 7-1(a) through 7-1(d) indicate the permit category of the responsible parties for
each management practice including the following mechanisms for tracking
implementation, with GAEPD responsible for enforcement:
• Energy, Municipal, Golf Course and Agricultural Water Withdrawal and Drinking
Water
• Municipal Wastewater Discharge
• Municipal and Construction Stormwater
• Safe Dams Program
7.2.1 Implementation of Water Conservation Management Practices
Table 7-1(a) lists implementation details for the 11 Water Conservation Management
Practices selected by the Council. The list includes a wide variety of practices, such

7.2.1 Implementation of Water Conservation Management Practices
Table 7-1(a) lists implementation details for the 11 Water Conservation Management
Practices selected by the Council. The list includes a wide variety of practices, such
as: (1) practices that are required by state law (WC-3, Stewardship Act practices),2) practices that are beneficial for all communities (WC-1, Implement education and
public awareness programs), and (3) practices that may be appropriate for some
communities but not others (WC-5, Encourage non-potable reuse). Each community
will need to continue to evaluate the practices to determine which are appropriate for
implementation in their community, and are encouraged to adopt all management
practices or other equally effective measures. Communities with Resource
Assessment gaps or infrastructure needs or shortages will continue to be encouraged
to implement these management practices to address their gaps, needs, or shortages.
All communities will continue to be required to report on their implementation activities
to the Council and to the GAEPD to help determine the effectiveness of the Regional
Water Plan. Finally, it is important to seek out opportunities for implementation across
state lines with partners to address impairments and improvements to inter-state
waters.
The industrial sector continually strides to implement water conservation practices that
increase productivity while decreasing water use. Particularly in the CNG Region, the
carpet industry has significantly reduced water usage per unit of carpet manufactured
due to industry process improvements, increased efficiencies, and conservations
efforts (GTMA, 2009).

not others (WS-2, Consider expansion of existing reservoirs). Each community will
need to continue to evaluate the management practices to determine which are
appropriate for implementation in their community. Communities with Resource
Assessment gaps or infrastructure needs or shortages are strongly encouraged to
implement these management practices to address their gaps, needs, or shortages.

7.2.3 Implementation of Wastewater Management Practices
Table 7-1(c) lists implementation details for the 8 Wastewater Management Practices
selected by the Council. The list includes a wide variety of practices, such as practices
that are beneficial for all communities (WW-1, Consider development of local
wastewater master plans to evaluate wastewater treatment and disposal options to
meet future demands) and practices that may be appropriate for some communities
but not others (WW-6, Consider developing a capacity certification program). Each
community will need to continue to evaluate the practices to determine which are
appropriate for implementation in their community. Communities with Resource
Assessment gaps or infrastructure needs or shortages are strongly encouraged to
implement these management practices to address their gaps, needs, or shortages.
All communities will need to report on their implementation activities to the Council and
to the GAEPD to help determine the effectiveness of the plan.Table 7-1(c): Implementation Schedule for Wastewater Management Practices

As discussed in Section 6, during the original plan development a review of regional
and local plans served as the basis for the development of the Region’s selected
management practices. As a result, this Regional Water Plan is generally aligned and
consistent with these efforts; however, the following sections describe ongoing efforts
and/or differences that are worth noting and revisiting during future Regional Water
Plan updates.
7.4.1 Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) Basin Master Water Control
Manual
The ACT Basin Master Water Control Manual is composed of a series of documents,
a Master Water Control Manual and 9 individual reservoir manuals. Water control
manuals describe the specific operations of the federal reservoir including storage and
release schedules to meet the authorized uses of the project. The USACE approved
the environmental impact statement (EIS) and the water control manuals for the ACT
basin on May 4, 2015. The updated water control manuals detail adjustments to
reservoir operations to meet the authorized purposes based on various factors and
conditions.4
In development of the updated resource assessments for the CNG Region, the
modeling team updated the hydrologic model used for the surface water availability
resource assessment analysis in the basin to incorporate the new water control
manuals and the updated operational protocols. However, no major changes in the
surface water availability resource assessment results were identified based on the
updated modeling.
7.4.2 Etowah Aquatic Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP)
In response to the number of imperiled aquatic species found in the Etowah
watershed, the USFWS initiated development of the Etowah Aquatic Habitat
Conservation Plan (HCP)5. The draft Etowah Aquatic HCP is currently working its way
through the USFWS review process. Once that is complete, each local government
that submitted an application for an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) will determine
whether it wants to move forward with acceptance of the ITP, which includes formal
adoption of the HCP. Many of the recommendations in the draft HCP were focused on
improving water quality through reduction of point and nonpoint source loadings,
reductions in sedimentation and erosion, and restoration or maintenance of hydrology.
The recommendations in the 2011 and in this updated regional plan related to water
quality and stormwater management will address many of the original HCP
recommendations.
4 http://www.sam.usace.army.mil/Missions/Planning-Environmental/ACT-Master-Water-Control-
Manual-Update/
5 http://www.etowahhcp.or7.4.3 Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District Plans
The Metro District was created by the Georgia General Assembly in 2001 to establish
policy, create plans, and promote intergovernmental coordination within the 15-county
metro Atlanta region, which includes more than 90 cities. While the Metro District is
governed by separate authorizing legislation than the CNG Water Planning Region,
the two are similar in some respects and the provisions of the 2008 State Water Plan
apply to planning activities by both entities. There are, however, differences. For
example, the Metro District is funded by State appropriations and per capita local
government dues; it is governed by an elected/appointed Governing Board, which sets
policy and direction. Metro District staffing is provided by the Atlanta Regional
Commission Environmental Planning Division, while plans and policies are guided by
the Board Executive and Finance Committees, the Technical Coordinating Committee,
and the Basin Advisory Councils (Metro District, 2011).
Similar to the CNG Regional Water Plan, local governments and utilities are
responsible for implementing the plans at the local level, but compliance with the Metro
District Plan is directly enforced through the GAEPD’s permitting process. While the
CNG Regional Water Plan will guide GAEPD’s future permitting decisions, local
governments must be in compliance with the District plans to receive a permit for an
increased water withdrawal, a new or increased discharge, or for an MS4 permit, with
GAEPD being responsible for auditing local governments to determine compliance
with the plans, including audit checklists and site visits.
The original Metro District Plan was approved in 2003 and was updated in 2009, and
is currently going through an update that will be completed in 2017 in conjunction with
the other 10 regional water plans. This update will result in an integrated water
resources management plan that integrates water supply and conservation,
wastewater and stormwater management components. A joint council meeting was
held with the Metro District to discuss the potential needs for future collaboration or
coordination on management practice implementation in January 2017. The points for
potential collaboration were primarily related to water supply and water quality
management practices in the Chattahoochee River Basin and Lake Allatoona
watersheds. Specifically, measures related to nonpoint source management are
emphasized in this plan to address the existing TMDL for nutrients in Lake Allatoona
and the pending TMDL for nutrients on Lake Lanier. Updates to the water quality
management practices focusing on post development stormwater controls and forestry
BMPs for sedimentation and erosion will address feedback from the Metro District
members regarding nonpoint source pollutant loading reductions to Lake Lanier.
7.4.4 Other Regional Planning Considerations
7.4.4.1 Water Supply Planning Considerations
Future development of water supplies in the CNG Region should continue to take into
consideration the availability of water from the Tennessee River Basin. A significant
portion of the Region is included in the Tennessee River watershed, and local entities
should have access to water contributed to the river from watersheds within north
Georgia. The CNG Council recognizes there are potential legal issues that would have
to be addressed between Georgia and Tennessee to facilitate usage of the TennesseeRiver; however, the Council would like future planning efforts to address this
alternative water source in more detail as needs arise.
Additionally, regional reservoir projects should continue to be evaluated to meet both
in-stream and off-stream needs within the CNG region. Portions of the CNG Region,
specifically in the Coosa basin, have the potential for development of new water supply
reservoirs that may provide sufficient yield to supply water to areas outside of the CNG
planning area. The CNG Council is not opposed to considering these options for
meeting future water supply needs in Georgia; however, the Council would like to
ensure that a complete and thorough evaluation is completed to verify that the CNG
basin water resource needs (both in-stream and off-stream) are met. This plan update
includes a recommendation to identify and map potential new reservoirs and
reservoirs that may be candidates for future expansion.
7.4.4.2 Total Maximum Daily Load (TMDL) Implementation
The State’s TMDL process establishes the allowable pollutant loadings or other
quantifiable parameters for a water body based on the relationship between pollutant
sources and in-stream water quality conditions. This allows water quality-based
controls to be developed to reduce pollution and restore and maintain water quality.
Integration of the CNG Region’s existing TMDL Implementation Plans was an
important component considered during the development and selection of the
management practices.
There are a number of streams segments in the CNG Region, including streams in
every county, that are on the 303(d) list of impaired waterbodies and/or have existing
TMDLs to address the identified impairments. As noted in Sections 3 and 5, the
streams are primarily listed for fecal coliform, impaired biota, or fish consumption
guidelines/commercial fishing ban due to legacy pollutants such as PCBs or metals.
The updated water quality management practices include recommendations with
greater emphasis on post-development stormwater controls, improved forestry BMP
practice implementation, and increased monitoring of listed stream segments.
Since the original plan was developed in 2011, TMDLs have been finalized to address
chlorophyll-a issues in Lake Allatoona (GAEPD, 2013) and Carter’s Lake (GAEPD,
2016). Studies also are currently under way to finalize the chlorophyll-a TMDL for
Lake Lanier. In each case, the local governments and utilities in the watersheds
leading to these three lakes will need to implement measures to further reduce nutrient
loadings in these watersheds. The CNG Council, with support from the Partnership,
has been studying options for cost effective nutrient reductions (see below) including
water quality nutrient trading. Most recently, the Partnership has initiated a nutrient
management study on the Soque River in the Chattahoochee River watershed that
will provide additional insight on specific measures for nutrient management. The
updated CNG plan provides the additional emphasis on stormwater management to
begin to address the needed nutrient reductions to comply with the TMDL
implementation plans for Lakes Allatoona and Carters, and in anticipation of a TMDL
implementation plan for Lake Lanier.7.4.4.3 Northwest Georgia Regional Water Resources Partnership
The Northwest Georgia Regional Water Resources Partnership was formed and
endorsed by the Board of Directors of both the Coosa Valley and North Georgia
Regional Commissions (known as RDCs at the time) in 2001 in recognition of the
importance of watershed planning. Water withdrawal and discharge permit holders
(government, water authority, industrial and private communities) and interested
entities not holding water permits (governments, quasigovernmental agencies,
environmental organizations, advocacy groups, and other interested entities) were
invited to participate, and an executive committee of 12 members was elected from
the membership. Many of the local governments, utilities and industries in the CNG
region are full participating members of the Partnership. The goals of the Partnership
include:
• Goal 1: Organize and increase our collective political influence on local, state and
national levels.
• Goal 2: Combine our resources to develop and implement watershed
assessments, water supply studies, and storm water management initiatives within
the region including the Coosa, Tallapoosa, and Tennessee River Basins.
• Goal 3: Educate legislators, citizens, and ourselves on surface and ground water
resources in the region.
• Goal 4: Obtain funding from a variety of sources for water related activities.
• Goal 5: Monitor, assess, and shape local, state, and national legislation on water
related issues.
• Goal 6: Monitor the proposed ACT and ACF water compact agreement.
• Goal 7: Serve as a coordinating mechanism for all regional water related activities
including development of the proposed State Comprehensive Water Resources
Management Plan.
The Partnership was endorsed by the CNG Council as the technical support group for
the Council in 2011, and has served as the primary entity supporting implementation
of the regional water plan. As noted in Section 7.1, over the last 5 years the
Partnership has received grants or used member funding to implement the following
studies:
• Nutrient Trading in the Coosa Basin: A Feasibility Study
• Redundancy and Emergency Interconnectivity Study
• Water Transmission Grid Study
• North Georgia Agricultural Water Use Study
• Soque River Nutrient Management StudyThe following are guidance documents produced by GAWP that the Partnership has
identified as tools for implementation of the regional water plan:
• Best Practice Master Planning Guidance and Resource Document
• A Guide to Asset Management for Small Water Systems
• Stormwater Program Guidance Manual for Small Local Governments
These documents and studies are available on the Partnership website.6
The Partnership will continue to provide technical and implementation support for the
CNG Council over the next 5-year period.
7.4.4.4 Lake Allatoona/Upper Etowah River Comprehensive Watershed Study
The Etowah River watershed above Allatoona Dam includes portions of eight counties:
Bartow, Cherokee, Cobb, Dawson, Forsyth, Fulton, Lumpkin, and Pickens. Dawson,
Lumpkin and Pickens counties in the CNG region are participating in the Study.
In response to the previously defined problems, Congress authorized the USACE to
address the water resource problems within the study area. The Lake Allatoona/Upper
Etowah River Watershed Study was authorized by Section 422 of the Water
Resources Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-541) to address streambank
and shoreline erosion, sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat
degradation, and other problems relating to ecosystem restoration and resource
protection in the Lake Allatoona Watershed.
The Watershed Assessment and Watershed Protection Plan planning effort are
designed to provide the data needed to make targeted improvement in the quality and
quantity of water and ecological conditions of Lake Allatoona and the Upper Etowah
River Watershed. This information will help county governments as they strive to
protect environmental quality and meet or exceed regulatory requirements, while
managing rapid growth in North Georgia (USACE, 2011b). Many of the
recommendations in the Watershed Protection Plan are reflected in the management
practices included in this plan.
