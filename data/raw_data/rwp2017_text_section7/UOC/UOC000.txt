Section 7. Implementing
Water Management Practices
This Section presents the Council’s roadmap for
implementing the water management practices
identified in Section 6. As the State Water Plan
indicates, this Regional Water Plan will be primarily
implemented by the various water users in the Region
along with the other responsible parties described
below.
Once adopted, this Regional Water Plan will be used
to guide permitting decisions by GAEPD and guide
the awarding of State grants and loans from the
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) for
water-related projects. And this plan can help inform
and guide other GAEPD programs such as the
awarding of Section 319(h) Nonpoint Source
Implementation Grant funds.
7.1 Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible Parties
Tables 7-1(a) through 7-1(d) identify the short- and long-term actions needed to implement
the Management Practices detailed in Tables 6-1(a) through 6-1(d) and the corresponding
responsible parties for each series of actions. Actions for implementation are framed as initial
activities expected to occur as short- or long-term actions. The Council has defined shortterm
as occurring within the next five years and long-term as beyond the next five years. It is
assumed that all long-term activities would occur after the 5-year Regional Water Plan
update, allowing for the Council to revisit these actions using an adaptive management
approach.
While the bulk of implementation actions noted in Tables 7-1(a) through 7-1(d) fall to local
governments and utilities and their respective RCs, extensive support for short term
activities, in particular, will be needed from State entities, such as GAEPD, DCA, Georgia
Department of Community Health (DCH), Division of Public Health, Environmental Health
Section, and GEFA. This Regional Water Plan also assumes continued support from the
Council in some capacity beyond its current 3-year appointment. Support from other
organizations, such as the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG),
Georgia Green Industry Association (GGIA), Georgia Municipal Association (GMA), Georgia
Rural Water Association (GRWA), and Georgia Association of Water Professionals (GAWP),
will also be needed to implement the management practices in an efficient, cost-effective
manner.

7.1.1 Implementation of Water Conservation Management Practices
Table 7-1(a) lists implementation details for the 10 Water Conservation Management
Practices selected by the Council and detailed in Table 6-1(a). The list includes a wide
variety of practices, such as practices that benefit all communities (e.g., WC-3, Implement
education and public awareness program) and practices that may be appropriate for some
communities, but not for others (e.g., WC-5, Encourage non-potable reuse). Each community
will need to evaluate all the practices to determine which are appropriate for it to implement.
Communities with Resource Assessment gaps or infrastructure needs/shortages are strongly
encouraged to implement these Water Conservation practices to address these water
resource issues. All communities will need to track and report on their implementation
activities as described in Section 8 to help monitor progress in meeting the benchmarks.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans
As discussed in Section 6, a review of regional and local plans served as the basis for the
development of the Region’s selected management practices; a summary of the local and
regional plans reviewed is provided in the supplemental document titled Review and
Summary of Existing Plans, which is available on the Council website.1 As a result, this
update of the Regional Water Plan is generally aligned and consistent with these efforts;
however, the following sections describe ongoing efforts and/or differences that are worth
noting and revisiting during future Regional Water Plan updates.
7.3.1 Metro Water District Plans
The Metro Water District was created by the Georgia General Assembly in 2001 to establish
policy, create plans, and promote intergovernmental coordination within the 15-County Metro
Atlanta region, which includes more than 90 cities. The Metro Water District is therefore
governed by a separate authorizing legislation than the Region, though the two are similar in
some respects. For example, the Metro Water District is funded by State appropriations and
per capita local government dues; it is governed by an elected/appointed Governing Board,
which sets policy and direction. Metro Water District staffing is provided by the Atlanta
Regional Commission Environmental Planning Division, while plans and policies are guided
by the Board Executive and Finance Committees, the Technical Coordinating Committee,
and the Basin Advisory Councils (Metro Water District, 2011).
Local governments and utilities are responsible for implementing the Regional Water Plans
at the local level, and compliance with the plans is directly enforced through the GAEPD’s
permitting process. However, while this Regional Water Plan will guide GAEPD’s future
permitting decisions, local governments must be in compliance with the Metro Water
District’s plans to obtain a permit for an increased water withdrawal or a new or increased
discharge, or to obtain an MS4 permit. GAEPD is responsible for auditing local governments
to determine compliance with the plans, including audit checklists and site visits.

Management Practices
June 2017
In May 2009, the Metro Water District adopted comprehensive updates to the plans the
District first adopted in 2003; these long-term water management plans address water supply
and water conservation, wastewater management, and watershed management.

7.4 Recommendations to the State
This subsection describes the Council’s recommendations to the State of Georgia for actions
that will support the implementation of this Regional Water Plan. Table 7-3 summarizes
these recommendations by type and reflects the role the Council envisions the State taking
in support of the activities described in Section 7.1.
Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State (Continued)
Recommendation
Funding Identify long-term funding mechanism, beyond grants, to assist responsible
parties with implementation.
Work with existing organizations such as the GSWCC to identify incentives to
encourage the installation and use of variable rate irrigation systems by a
certified irrigation professional.
Identify funding assistance (grants or loans) for small community water systems
that have had to shut down their groundwater supply wells and move onto
surface water withdrawal and treatment systems based upon radionuclides
levels of concern in groundwater.
These systems fall within an area of the Upper Oconee Region that is known to
have such levels of concern based on geologic conditions. Funding assistance
may include grant or loan programs administered by DCA or GEFA, and may
also include federal funding sources from USEPA or USDA.
Coordination Coordinate with DCA and the RCs to serve as the clearing house and
coordinator for ongoing Regional Water Plan planning activities.
To provide continuity between Regional Water Plan updates, a minimum of six
to nine members of the original Council should be re-appointed. Vacancies at
each level should also be determined to assist when considering
reappointments.
The Council should meet a minimum of once a year (as directed by the
Chairperson) to track implementation and address potential issues or questions
regarding implementation or plan amendments. A Planning Contractor should
be available to the Council to assist with coordination as well as implementation
tracking or plan amendments.
Invite regional utility directors to the annual Council Meetings.
Work with existing organizations, such as ACCG, GMA and GAWP to develop
templates and materials that each Regional Council, with the assistance of
DCA or the RCs noted in Section 2.3, can adapt for regional / local
implementation.
Topic areas from Table 7-1 could include: public education program, water
conservation goals, regional residential and commercial water audit program
materials, golf course water management, grease management, CMOM,
general stormwater management and stream buffer protection.
Work with existing organizations such as the GSWCC, United States
Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the State’s University System to
develop regional watering, nutrient management, cropland management
guidelines for the major crops grown in the Region.

Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State (Continued)
Recommendation
Coordinate with State and local Public Health Departments to:
 Develop consistent, minimum design standards that anticipate future
centralized sewer connections where appropriate.
 Develop example policies for connections to public sewer.
 Develop regional recommendations and a model ordinance for
decentralized sewer systems.
Coordinate with GEMA on development of a model flood damage prevention
ordinance.
Policy /
Programmatic
Consider modifying (limiting) the extent of exemptions found in O.C.G.A. § 12-
7-17 regarding the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act.
Increase enforcement capabilities for GSWCC as well as local erosion and
sedimentation control acts.
Revisit DO criteria for South Georgia, and the Region in particular, to consider
naturally low background levels found in the Region.
Build on existing GAEPD monitoring program to develop a regional long-term
ambient trend monitoring network for the Region.
Evaluate methodologies to shorten the timing for the permitting process on new
reservoir systems.
Next 5-Year
Update
Refine Resource Assessment models to allow presentation of results at a finer
resolution.
Collect and monitor withdrawal and discharge data from industries to refine the
water balance and wastewater return ratio assumptions.
Support the evaluation of the current in-stream flow policy to determine whether
revisions are needed to protect aquatic resources.
