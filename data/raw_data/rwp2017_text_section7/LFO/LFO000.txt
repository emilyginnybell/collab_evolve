LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE
Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices
This section presents the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council’s
roadmap for the implementation of the management practices identified in Section 6.
It details schedules for implementation, responsible parties, and cost estimates for
implementation. It also describes the alignment of this Regional Water Plan with
other plans that address or relate to water resources in this water planning region. It
ends with recommendations from the Council related to information needed to
improve future planning and water policy changes that would facilitate attainment of
the Council’s vision and goals for the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning
Region.
7.1 Implementation Schedule and Responsible Parties
Table 7-1 details actions, identifies responsible parties, and provides timeframes for
implementation of the management practices in Table 6-1. Short-term practices are
those which will be implemented or encouraged over the five-year timeframe leading
up to the next update of this Plan. Long-term management practices vary in duration
and scope and will require further study and development to define time
requirements. As noted in Section 6, the Council selected these management
practices to apply to the whole Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Region.
Although the region’s boundaries encompass multiple surface water and
groundwater resources, the Council believes that the management practices will
benefit all water resources in this water planning region.
SUMMARY: This section presents the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning
Council’s roadmap for the implementation of the water management practices
identified in Section 6. Implementation actions and responsible parties are
described, and schedules and costs are specified, where appropriate. The
Council’s research and policy recommendations are also included in this section.

7.2 Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management
Practices
Table 7-2 provides planning-level cost estimates for implementation of the
management practices in this Regional Water Plan. Sources of potential funding are
also listed. The cost information in Table 7-2 is based upon cost guidance prepared
by EPD in April 2011. Neither the guidance nor the cost estimates shown in the
following tables have been updated since 2011. Accordingly, the values shown
below should only be used as a general guide. Specific costs should be further
evaluated and updated before being relied upon.
The availability of funding is a critical determinant in the ability of the responsible
parties to successfully implement the management practices identified in this
Regional Water Plan. In general, sources of funding for individuals, such as farmers,
include investment by these individuals and grant and incentive programs. Sources
of funding for implementing management practices at the local government or utility
level include revenues generated by water and wastewater providers, local
government general funds raised through property taxes, and service fees charged
by local governments to citizens. Local governments and utilities can also apply for
loans and grants to finance implementation. Affected authorities and individuals in
the water planning region will be responsible for determining the best method for
funding and implementing applicable management practices.

a) Programmatic costs will vary widely depending on the specific actions selected. Further study
and data are needed to refine the evaluation of costs and benefits of selected practices. All
values should be viewed as planning level numbers that before application for program
planning or other purposes, will need updating through further study and data collection
regarding the level of baseline implementation already in place and the corresponding water
quantity and quality benefits achieved.
b) Cost per million gallons is a cost benefit metric, which is defined as the total 2010 costs divided
by the total millions of gallons yielded or saved through conservation per year.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans
The development of this Plan by the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning
Council builds upon a knowledge base developed in previous planning efforts by
7-14 June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE
state and local governments and authorities. In the last planning cycle, the Lower
Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council conducted a comprehensive review of
existing local and regional plans and relevant related documents that concern water
resources to frame the selection of management practices. A supplemental
document entitled Existing Regulatory and Local Plan Summary (2011) summarizes
this effort; it is available on the Council’s website. The Council considered known
plan updates in the review and revision process for this Plan.
The Council also ensured alignment with other Regional Water Plans by coordinating
with neighboring water planning councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District. The Council participated in a joint meeting with several other water
planning councils, including the Upper Flint, Middle Chattahoochee, and Coosa-
North Georgia Water Planning Councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District. In this meeting, council members discussed shared issues relating
to resource availability, quality, policy, regulatory, and funding issues.
The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council included joint
recommendations with the Upper Flint and Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning
Councils in its 2011 plan, and this revised plan updates the joint recommendations
(see Section 7.4). The Council coordinated with these neighboring water planning
councils with the support of the planning contractor to align the joint
recommendations. Additionally, the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council
reviewed the draft water resources plan of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District and submitted comments to the District on the draft plan in February
2017. The Council’s water planning region also includes a small part of the
Suwannee River Basin, and therefore, the planning contractor supported the Council
in reviewing the Satilla-Suwannee Water Planning Council’s plan to ensure plan
alignment for shared resources. Through these efforts, the Council has coordinated
its plan with neighboring water planning councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia
Water Planning District. No conflicts with these regional water plans have been
identified. Alignment with the existing Flint River Basin Regional Water Development
and Conservation Plan (2006) was considered by the Council. While the Council’s
recommendations improve upon the 2006 plan, none of its recommendations conflict
with that plan.1
7.4 Recommendations to the State
The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council has identified several
recommended actions that would improve water resource management and planning
in this water planning region and the State as a whole.
Information Needs
1 The 2006 Flint River Basin Regional Water Development and Conservation Plan is described in Section 2.3 and
available on the EPD website: http://www1.gadnr.org/frbp/index.html.

LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE
Addressing the following information needs would support improved water resources
management and future water planning. Implementation of research and
assessments to fill these information needs will require funding (state, federal, other).
Implementing agencies are not indicated here; if funding is identified, qualified
researchers from state universities, institutions, and agencies, as well as private
sector firms, can fulfill these information needs. As new information is developed, it
should be incorporated into future cycles of the regional water planning process and
used in the resource assessments that are a part of the regional water planning
process.
· Evaluate the potential environmental and other impacts of low flow
conditions seen in model results at the Bainbridge planning node; determine
low flow thresholds below which adverse ecosystem impacts are predicted.
· Improve implementation of the agricultural water withdrawal metering
program administered by EPD by:
o Completing comprehensive installation of meters
o Ensuring the meters are functioning properly through regular
maintenance inspection
o Increasing data collection on parameters including monthly
use, crops, inputs
o Continuing to report aggregate results annually to permittees
and policymakers
o Continuing to prepare collected data in a manner that will
facilitate use in future resource assessments
· Complete a comprehensive assessment of baseline implementation of
water conservation and water quality BMPs by agricultural producers.
Recent efforts to conduct field verification of conservation equipment
adoption by farmers in the Lower Flint River Basin have initiated
development of a baseline dataset. The Council recommends that this
survey be expanded to include a wider geographic range, including the
entire Flint and Chattahoochee River Basins, and to assess implementation
of more conservation practices. The lack of comprehensive information on
current levels of implementation limits the ability to conduct effective
regional water planning. Without a more thorough understanding of the
baseline level of implementation, the benefits of future conservation
activities cannot be accurately estimated. A comprehensive field survey of
BMP implementation, for conservation and water quality practices would
support estimation of potential benefits of future implementation, tracking of
implementation progress, and BMP prioritization.
· Continue to evaluate implementation, adoption, and effectiveness of water
conservation practices and to research innovative conservation practices.
Water conservation is a priority focus of the management practices in this

Plan, but there are currently several practical limitations to measuring
progress and impact in conservation implementation, such as inconsistent
terminology, lack of available data and the need to identify practical ways of
collecting data. Periodically, it will be important to assess the progress and
benefit of the water conservation program.
· Evaluate the impacts of farm ponds on stream flows through intercepted
drainage and evaporative loss. Also continue to improve how farm pond
withdrawals are incorporated into the resource assessment models.
· Evaluate the costs and benefits of reducing the minimum threshold at which
permits are required for water withdrawals (surface water and groundwater).
· Promote additional studies that build on existing work related to drought,
drought triggers and potential actions needed to maintain water quality in
the Flint River Basin in dry periods.
· Evaluate alternative metrics for use as thresholds for potential gaps in the
resource assessment models. For the surface water availability resource
assessment, the Council should provide input to EPD on preferences,
values, and possible metrics related to desired flows in the region’s surface
waters.
· Evaluate changes in the recently updated Water Control Manual for U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers management in the Chattahoochee River Basin to
seek to enhance the capacity of the system to support all uses, including
greater storage for water supply and flow augmentation.
· Verify water quality model assumptions in future resource assessments to
reflect actual conditions through an interactive process between the regional
water planning councils and EPD. In particular, check assumptions about
the volumes treated by various wastewater treatment methods (e.g., land
application, discharging facility). The assumption that current allocations
among these methods will remain the same may not be accurate given instream
flow concerns.
· Evaluate the effectiveness of water quality management and pollution
prevention tools, including best management practices for nonpoint
sources. Continue to develop data on nutrient loading to support the
development of effective nutrient management strategies, especially in the
Ochlockonee River Basin.
· Conduct periodic peer review on the resource assessment models used in
regional water planning.
Water Policy Recommendations
The following recommendations urge the Georgia General Assembly and other
policymakers (e.g., Georgia Board of Natural Resources) to pursue actions to
June 2017 7-17
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE
improve water resource management in the State and the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee
Water Planning Region.
· The Council recommends that the General Assembly seek input from and
consult with the regional water planning councils, including the Lower Flint-
Ochlockonee Water Planning Council, in managing, planning, and providing
oversight of water resources within each region around the state.
· The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly provide
funding for continued planning by the regional water planning councils in
order to ensure continued progress toward the vision and goals of the State
Water Plan and Regional Water Plan. The Council also recommends that
the General Assembly provide funding to support monitoring of plan
implementation, data collection to support future planning by the regional
water planning councils, and continued refinement of water resource
assessments used in the development of the Regional Water Plans.
· The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly and
implementing state and federal agencies, explore all possible funding
sources to offset or pay for many of the management practices outlined in
this Plan. Federal funding sources should be fully explored, particularly
USDA funding for conservation research and implementation. Financial
incentives and reimbursement for implementation of practices will expedite
the progress needed to achieve the goals of this Plan.
· The Council urges the Georgia General Assembly and other state
policymakers not to preclude interbasin transfer as an option for future
water management in the region, as needed and following thorough
scientific evaluation. Interbasin transfer (IBT) of water can provide supply or
flows to a receiving basin where water is needed. IBTs are used in many
places in Georgia at this time. However, the Council recommends against
any new interbasin transfers from any basin in this region for which the
surface water availability resource assessment model indicated a potential
gap. Furthermore, the Council recommends that, where appropriate and
reasonable to address instream flow concerns, existing IBTs be reversed to
return water to its basin of origin.
· The Council recommends that any modifications to existing water
withdrawal permitting practices should consider the updated surface water
availability and groundwater availability resource assessment model results.
For a more complete discussion of the Council’s concerns with the modeling
approaches and results, please see Section 5.4.
· The Council urges the state to continue developing improved tools for
drought management and to adopt legislation as needed for their
implementation. The Council believes that additional tools beyond those
provided in the Flint River Drought Protection Act (OCGA §12-5-40) are
7-18 June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE
needed to provide for an adequate remedy in periods of drought, and
adequate funding should be provided for implementation.
· The Council recommends that the General Assembly provide funding and
authority (or other mechanism) for the Council to work with the USFWS to
resolve potential conflicts between agricultural water use and imperiled
species in the region. The Council urges all appropriate state agencies to
join in this process, including the EPD. A Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP)
feasibility study was conducted between 2011 and 2014 in response to a
request from the Council. It was led by the Georgia Water Planning and
Policy Center and involved numerous agencies and stakeholders from this
region. The project provided information that can be used to advance
consideration of alternative approaches to address imperiled species
concerns in the region. The Council supports continued consideration of a
Habitat Conservation Plan as a tool that should be evaluated to provide for
both habitat protection and irrigation supply needs in the region, while also
reducing the liability and uncertainty associated with potential Endangered
Species Act enforcement or litigation.
· The Council urges the State to seek a timely resolution of current interstate
water issues that directly affect the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin.
The Council recommends the development of a tri-state framework
designed to address interstate water issues in the future and the inclusion of
the regional water councils within this framework. See below for a
coordinated recommendation with neighboring councils regarding an ACF
planning and management institution.
· The Council recommends continued coordination and cooperation among
neighboring water councils. The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning
Council has worked closely with the Middle Chattahoochee and Upper Flint
Water Planning Councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District, and our joint efforts will benefit our regions and the State
as a whole.
Coordinated Recommendations with Neighboring Councils
Since the beginning of regional water planning in Georgia in 2009, the Lower Flint-
Ochlockonee Water Planning Council has met several times with neighboring
regional water planning councils to discuss shared water resources and topics of
concern. The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Council met several times
with the Upper Flint and Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Councils and
developed a collaborative relationship with these councils that led to their agreement
on a set of joint recommendations in 2011. In this planning cycle, the three councils
reviewed and revised their joint recommendations. In 2017, the following joint
recommendations were approved by all three councils: Upper Flint, Lower Flint-
Ochlockonee, and Middle Chattahoochee. The agreement among these councils on
these recommendations indicates the importance of these recommendations to the
June 2017 7-19

LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE
Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin, of which all three councils are a part, and to
the State as a whole.
These joint recommendations overlap with some of the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee
Water Planning Council’s own management practices and recommendations. Where
overlap does occur, the Council does not see any conflict; the Council’s
management practices and recommendations generally provide more detail than the
joint recommendations. In all cases, the Council’s own regional water plan takes
precedence over the joint recommendations.
The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, Upper Flint, and Middle Chattahoochee Water
Planning Councils:
· Recognize the critical need for better use of existing storage and for more
storage in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) System and
recommend that a plan for additional storage be developed and
implemented and that it consider the following: better utilization of existing
storage in the Chattahoochee River Basin, new storage in the Flint River
Basin, and enhancement of existing storage capacity.
· Urge EPD and those involved in the resource assessment modeling to
improve upon existing models for future regional water planning by further
expanding use of actual and current data on water use and conditions and
by continuing to refine assumptions that more closely approximate actual
conditions.
· Consider the creation of a new coordinated, interstate planning organization
for the ACF System. Membership in this organization to represent Georgia
shall include, but not be limited to, members of the regional water planning
councils with water planning regions that include parts of the ACF. Consider
the recommendation of the ACF Stakeholders in its Sustainable Water
Management Plan regarding an ACF transboundary water management
institution as this organization is developed.2
