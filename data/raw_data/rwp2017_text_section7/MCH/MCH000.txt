Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices
This section presents the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council’s roadmap
for the implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6. It
details schedules for implementation, responsible parties, and cost estimates for
implementation. It also describes the alignment of this Regional Water Plan with
other plans that address or relate to water resources in this water planning region. It
ends with recommendations from the Council related to information needed to
improve future planning and water policy changes that would facilitate attainment of
the Council’s vision and goals for the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region.
7.1 Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible
Parties
Table 7-1 details actions, identifies responsible parties, and provides timeframes for
implementation of the management practices detailed in Table 6-1. Short-term
practices are those which will be implemented or encouraged over the five-year
timeframe leading up to the next update of this Plan. Long-term management
practices vary in duration and scope and will require further study and development
to define time requirements. Responsible parties listed in Table 7-1 will be the actors
that implement this Plan. As the State Water Plan provides, this Plan will be primarily
implemented by the water users in the region. Responsible parties also include state
and federal agencies, university researchers, Soil and Water Conservation Districts,
and regional water planning councils.
SUMMARY: This section presents the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning
Council’s roadmap for the implementation of the water management practices
identified in Section 6. Implementation actions and responsible parties are
described, and schedules and costs are specified, where appropriate. The Council’s
research and policy recommendations are also included in this section.

7.2 Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management
Practices
The availability of funding and time are critical determinants in successful
implementation of management practices. Sources of funding for programs and
studies identified in the selected management practices include revenues generated
by water and wastewater providers, local government general funds raised through
property taxes, and service fees charged by local governments to citizens.
Alternatively, water providers and individuals can apply for loans and/or grants to
7-8 June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
finance capital improvement practices or programs. Affected authorities and
individuals in the water planning region will be responsible for determining the best
method for funding and implementing applicable management practices. Several
funding methods are outlined below:
 Water/Wastewater Rates – Water rates should be based on a local
rate study and be sufficient to support program costs and facility
maintenance.
 General Appropriations (General Fund) – Includes revenues from
local taxes
 Loans/Bonds – Includes immediate borrowing of funds over a 15 to 20
year period with interest charges; typically used for capital
improvement projects
 General Obligation Bonds – Based upon local
government taxing powers
 Revenue Bonds – Based upon revenues generated by a
specific entity for service fees and water/wastewater rates
 Georgia Environmental Finance Authority Loans – Low
interest state loans for environmental projects; the Clean
Water State Revolving Loan Fund is administered by
GEFA
 WaterFirst – Administered by the Georgia Department of
Community Affairs; communities who apply for and
become designated as WaterFirst communities receive
discounts on GEFA loan interest rates
 Service Fees – Special taxes established by local governments for
specific programs
 Grants – State or federal financial aid which may fully or partially fund
projects; typically awarded on a competitive basis
 Section 319(h) – Under the federal Clean Water Act,
Section 319(h) provides federal funding
 Federal Special Appropriations Act Projects cost-share
program
Table 7-2 provides planning-level cost estimates for implementation of the
management practices in this Plan. Sources of potential funding are also listed. The
cost information in Table 7-2 is based upon cost guidance prepared by EPD in April
2011. Neither the guidance nor the cost estimates shown in the table have been
updated since 2011. Accordingly, the values shown below should only be used as a
general guide. Specific costs should be further evaluated and updated before being
relied upon.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans
The development of this Plan by the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council
builds on a knowledge base developed in previous planning efforts by state and local
governments and authorities. In the last planning cycle, the Middle Chattahoochee
Water Planning Council conducted a comprehensive review of existing local and
regional plans relevant related documents that concern water resources to frame the
selection of management practices. A supplemental document entitled Existing
Regulatory and Local Plan Summary (2011) summarizes this effort; it is available on
the Council’s website. The Council considered known plan updates in the review and
revision process for this Plan. When possible, successful management practices
already planned for and/or in use in this water planning region formed the basis for
the water management practices selected by the Council for this Plan.
Recommended actions in this Plan were selected so as not to conflict with other
existing state or regional plans. Management practice selection was also guided by
existing state rules, regulations, guidance documents, and best management
practices to ensure alignment with and enhancement of existing practices. The
authorities, counties, and municipalities throughout the water planning region should
consider the resource availability constraints presented herein in future local
planning efforts. Those entities also must implement, promote, and/or encourage the
selected management practices listed to ensure that they remain aligned with the
regional vision and goals of the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council.
The Council also ensured alignment with other Regional Water Plans by coordinating
with neighboring water planning councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District. The Council participated in a joint meeting with several other water
planning councils, including the Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Coosa-
North Georgia Water Planning Councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District. In this meeting, council members discussed shared issues relating
to resource availability, quality, policy, regulatory, and funding issues.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council included joint recommendations
with the Upper Flint and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Planning Councils in its
2011 plan, and this revised plan updates the joint recommendations (see Section
7.4). The Council coordinated with these neighboring water planning councils with
the support of the planning contractor to align the joint recommendations.
Additionally, the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council reviewed the draft
water resources plan of the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District and
submitted comments to the District on the draft plan in February 2017. Through
these efforts, the Council has coordinated its plan with neighboring water planning
councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District.

7.4 Recommendations to the State
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council has identified the following
recommendations to the State. The Council intends these actions to begin following
acceptance and issuance of the Regional Water Plan.
1. Improve the Updated ACF Water Control Manual and Operating Procedures
The Council advocates that the three states in the ACF basin work with the
USACE to improve the updated ACF Water Control Manual through:
 Increased protection for water quality in the Chattahoochee River in
the Middle Chattahoochee region. Operations in the river by the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers should acknowledge and operate
consistently with Federal Energy Regulatory Commission license
requirements and permit conditions in the ACF Basin. (See
Management Practice IU-1 and Table 6-2).
 Evaluation of revisions in the rule curve for winter drawdown for West
Point Lake and the storage capacity for Lake Lanier, as described in
Management Practice IU-2 and Table 6-2. Cooperative efforts
between the State and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers should be
funded and implemented to fully evaluate and support adoption of the
proposed rule curve modifications.
 Modeling of Chattahoochee River operations under extreme
conditions to evaluate system resilience, as described in Management
Practice IU-2.
 Adoption of the performance measures and operations set used in the
Georgia Contemplation, submitted by the State of Georgia to the U.S.
Army Corps of Engineers in 2013. The performance measures and
operations used in this model reflect many of the interests of the
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council in providing for
instream uses and demonstrate improvements in instream flows and
lake levels to support all uses of the system.
 Consideration of improvements to operations evaluated in the
modeling conducted by Dr. Georgakakos of the Georgia Water
Resources Institute at the Georgia Institute of Technology to support
the development of the Sustainable Water Management Plan by the
ACF Stakeholders, Inc. The proposed changes considered in this
modeling effort indicate that the improvements in operations may
more effectively balance water withdrawals, instream uses and the
Congressionally authorized purposes of the federal reservoirs.
 Evaluation of whether windows for navigation can be coordinated with
springtime pulse flows to support aquatic ecological needs.
June 2017 7-17
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
 Improvement of the scientific justification for required minimum flows
below Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam in the Apalachicola River.
 Evaluation of alternative structural hydraulic measures such as
temporary weirs, gates, and/or steps to control river stage and
sediment transport and scour at or below Woodruff Dam in order to
protect critical habitat.
 Comprehensive review and update of the Unimpaired Flows dataset
for the ACF System through a cooperative effort by the USACE and
the three states in the Basin.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recognizes that specific
operating targets should be based on detailed modeling and analysis. However,
the Council advocates for improvements to increase available storage in the
reservoirs, provide more rapid refill after drought periods, maintain higher lake
levels especially on West Point Lake, and provide flow guidelines at the
Columbus and Columbia planning nodes. The Council urges the states in the
ACF to work with the USACE to evaluate these recommended improvements.
2. Establish Task Forces for Alabama and Energy Water Use Forecasting
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region shares several water
resources with Alabama. Since the last planning cycle, more information has
become available on current Alabama water demands, but forecasts of Alabama
water demands were not available for this planning cycle. Cooperative efforts
between Georgia and Alabama are needed to support improvements in planning
by both states for shared water resources. Data is needed to support planning
with current and future demand estimates that are based on common planning
horizons and forecasting assumptions.
The EPD developed energy water use forecasts for the 2011 and 2017 planning
cycles, but this forecasting did not identify geographically specific water needs.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends additional
efforts to understand future water use by the energy sector in this water planning
region. Energy water use forecasting should also account for greater cooling
tower efficiencies, energy conservation, future increases in power production,
water quality, and other factors, as appropriate.
The Council recommends that EPD designate task forces to develop improved
water use forecasts for use in future planning cycles.
3. Increase Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District Returns
and Reduce Nutrient & Sediment Loading
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council has met with the
Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District in this planning cycle to
7-18 June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
discuss the District plan update as well as the Council’s plan review and revision
process. The Council appreciates the District’s commitment to coordination and
cooperation in planning. The Council has communicated its concerns to the
District in these discussions and in its comments on the Districts draft updated
water plan in February 2017.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council commends the District for its
water conservation achievements in the past several years. The District’s
commitment to conservation supports sustainable management of shared water
resources in the ACF System. However, the Council advocates for the District to
focus on increasing wastewater returns from the District to the ACF System. The
Council believes that the District could improve its efforts to increase returns. The
Council also requests that the District provide auditable reporting on the level of
wastewater returns from the District.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council is also concerned about
nutrient loading. The Council is concerned about increases in chlorophyll-a in
West Point Lake and Lake Walter F. George that may result from upstream
nutrient loading and the potential for degradation of lake water quality. The
Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Region should not be burdened with
additional waste water treatment or storm water BMPs caused by increases in
upstream discharges. In addition, the Council is also concerned about sediment
loading from upstream land management practices.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council requests that the
Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District: 1) provide specific details of
how the increased nutrient and sediment loads will be mitigated before it reaches
the Middle Chattahoochee Basin, 2) provide annual progress reports of nutrient
and sediment levels and reduction effectiveness, and 3) support the collection
and use of better field data for nutrient modeling to improve our understanding of
how to protect water quality. The State should evaluate tighter nutrient standards
for West Point Lake as a tool for basinwide water quality improvement.
The management of water quality in the Chattahoochee River Basin can be
improved with a better understanding of the sources of nutrient and sediment
loading and the effectiveness of management strategies. In particular, the
quantification of the impacts of best management practices and evaluation of infield
effectiveness is needed to improve nutrient management in the Basin.
Studies should be pursued with State leadership to address this important
information need. Wastewater facilities and stormwater programs collect water
quality data, as required by their permits, and this data should be incorporated
into water quality assessment by the State to expand the information base for
water quality management. Finally, the Council recommends periodic peer
review of the lake and watershed models used in the water quality resource
assessment. Additionally, EPD should develop an interactive process with the
June 2017 7-19
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
regional water councils to review and refine model assumptions and calibration
and to discuss and improve how the model is used in the regulatory setting.
4. Continue Research on Groundwater Development
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council previously recommended
that EPD support well development below the Fall Line and in watersheds not
directly impacted by surface water to groundwater interactions in order to reduce
reliance on direct river withdrawals. The Council recommended such
development in aquifers that may currently be under-utilized to augment
municipal, industrial and agricultural supplies as an alternative to continued
dependence on major surface water sources such as the Chattahoochee River
Basin.
In the past several years, EPD has supported several projects to evaluate
groundwater development for this purpose. These projects have identified
potential areas where groundwater development may present a viable alternative
water source in areas where low streamflows are a concern in drought periods.
However, these studies do not support a comprehensive strategy for such
groundwater development. The Council recommends continued efforts to
develop this approach as a potential future management practice.
To achieve better agricultural water use data (both groundwater and surface
water) the Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends improved
implementation of the state’s agricultural water withdrawal metering program
through:
 Completing comprehensive installation of meters
 Ensuring the meters are functioning properly through regular
maintenance inspection
 Increasing data collection on parameters including monthly use,
crops, inputs
5. Increase Storage in the ACF and Tallapoosa
This Regional Water Plan discusses the need to increase storage in the ACF
system for both water withdrawal and instream uses and in the Tallapoosa Basin
to mitigate modeled surface water availability gaps. Several means to increase
storage are discussed, including better utilization of available storage, building
more storage, and seeking to identify new methods of storage such as aquifer
storage and recovery for areas with potential gaps, such as the Flint River Basin.
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends that EPD
develop these conceptual ideas further and provide a more comprehensive plan
for increasing storage in the ACF and Tallapoosa River Basins. The concept of
7-20 June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
designating environmental storage in the existing federal reservoirs should be
explored for the purpose of improving the reliability of meeting consumptive use
and downstream flow targets during drought conditions. The Council encourages
the study and development of new storage in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-
Flint and Tallapoosa basins to address potential gaps identified in the surface
water availability resource assessment (Bainbridge, Heflin, and Newell nodes),
improve reliability of drought contingency plans, and alleviate the burden of
operational requirements on the federal reservoirs in the Middle Chattahoochee
Basin which have become the “work horses” of the ACF system.
6. Evaluate Water Conservation
Water conservation is a critical element of this Regional Water Plan. Currently
there are several practical limitations to measuring progress in implementation,
including inconsistent terminology, lack of available data, and the need to identify
practical ways of collecting data. Periodically, it will be important to assess the
progress and benefit of the water conservation implementation.
Recommendations throughout this Plan are intended to address the existing
limitations to the degree practicable to develop a sound method of measuring
regional progress. The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council
acknowledges and commends efforts made since the last planning cycle to
assess baseline conservation implementation and recommends continued
commitment to developing this information base.
7. Address Regional Assimilative Capacity Limitations
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends the following to
address potential limitations to assimilative capacity, especially in the lower part
of the Chattahoochee River Basin (below Walter F. George Reservoir):
 The State of Georgia should work with USACE and EPA to improve
water quality conditions (assimilative capacity) below Walter F.
George Reservoir.
 GAEPD should conduct more detailed assimilative capacity model
verification and consider existing discharge permit revisions to ensure
assimilative capacity is available in the Chattahoochee River below
Walter F. George Reservoir to support economic development.
8. Fund Additional Resource Assessments
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends that the
Georgia General Assembly provide funding for on-going additional data collection
and the continued refinement of water resource assessments used in the
development of this Plan. For water quantity, the Council recommends that the
June 2017 7-21
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
State consider further study of the ACF Basin in its resource assessment
modeling to consider:
 Modeling constraints and metrics associated with the adaptive
reservoir management model for the ACF Basin developed by the
Georgia Water Resources Institute (GWRI) at the Georgia Institute of
Technology: Modeling of the ACF was conducted by GWRI to support
the development of the Sustainable Water Management Plan by the
ACF Stakeholders, Inc. This modeling effort demonstrated desirable
improvements in operations to balance water withdrawals, instream
uses and the Congressional authorized purposes of the federal
reservoirs.
 Modeling of Chattahoochee River operations under extreme
conditions to evaluate system resilience, as described in Management
Practice IU-2.
 Better assessment of the regional water balance through improved
understanding of consumptive uses and related water returns: This
information will support improved planning and management
consumptive uses and allow the Council’s vision of an abundant water
supply for our descendants to be achieved. (See Management
Practice WW-2.)
 Assessment of water quality data relative to baseline best
management practice (BMP) implementation data and evaluation of
the effectiveness of those BMPs: Without this information, it is difficult
to assign management practices to address modeled water quality
gaps. These information needs could be addressed, at least in part,
through: 1) surveys of BMP implementation using an approach similar
to that implemented by the Georgia Forestry Commission for forestry
BMPS, and 2) increased use in assessment and management of
water quality data collected by wastewater and stormwater permittees
to fulfill permit requirements. Additionally, research on BMP
effectiveness for stormwater and agriculture is needed to evaluate
which practices should be prioritized.
The Georgia Forestry Commission’s BMP complaint and survey
program could be considered as a model for the agricultural sector. A
similar approach could be implemented through a partnership among
agricultural producers, the National Resource and Conservation
Service, and the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission.
This type of approach would provide documentation necessary to
substantiate the concerns of the agricultural community regarding
nutrient, bacteria, and dissolved oxygen levels in streams. This
program could also support the development of a dataset on baseline
implementation of agricultural BMPs.
7-22 June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
Wastewater and stormwater permittees are required collect water
quality monitoring data as a condition of their permits. EPD could work
with these permittees to develop monitoring networks that would
complement the monitoring efforts of the EPD and others if funding
were made available.
9. Increase State Funding for Implementation of Management Practices
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends that EPD
explore all possible funding sources to offset or pay for many of the management
practices and recommendations outlined in this Regional Water Plan. Financial
incentives and reimbursement for implementation will expedite the progress
needed to achieve the goals of this Plan.
10. Strengthen Coordination in Regional Water Planning and Management
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council recommends that the
Georgia General Assembly study and codify into state law a plan whereby the
planning, management and oversight of water and watershed resources in the
state be delegated to stakeholder led water or watershed councils. Water
councils should have funding and staff for ongoing research, studies,
assessments, measurement, monitoring, and reporting on the progress of goals
and future updates to the Regional Water Plans.
11. Coordinated Recommendations with Neighboring Councils
Since the beginning of regional water planning in Georgia in 2009, the Middle
Chattahoochee Water Planning Council has met several times with neighboring
regional water planning councils and the Metropolitan North Georgia Water
Planning District to discuss shared water resources and topics of concern. The
Council met several times with the Upper Flint and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee
Water Planning Councils and developed a collaborative relationship with these
councils that led to their agreement on a set of joint recommendations.
The following joint recommendations were approved by all three water planning
councils: Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Middle Chattahoochee. The
agreement among these councils on these recommendations indicates the
importance of these recommendations to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint
System, of which all three councils are a part, and to the State as a whole.
These joint recommendations overlap with some of the Middle Chattahoochee
Water Planning Council’s management practices and recommendations. Where
overlap does occur, the Council does not see any conflict; usually, the Council’s
management practices and recommendations provide more detail than the joint
recommendation. In all cases, the Council’s Regional Water Plan takes
precedence over the joint recommendations.
June 2017 7-23
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
MIDDLE CHATTAHOOCHEE
The Middle Chattahoochee, Upper Flint, and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water
Planning Councils:
 Recognize the critical need for better use of existing storage and for
more storage in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) System
and recommend that a plan for additional storage be developed and
implemented and that it consider the following: better utilization of
existing storage in the Chattahoochee River Basin, new storage in the
Flint River Basin, and enhancement of existing storage capacity.
 Urge EPD and those involved in the resource assessment modeling to
improve upon existing models for future regional water planning by
further expanding use of actual and current data on water use and
conditions and continuing to refine assumptions to more closely
approximate actual conditions.
 Consider the creation of a new coordinated, interstate planning
organization for the ACF System. Membership in this organization to
represent Georgia shall include, but not be limited to, members of the
regional water planning councils with water planning regions that
include parts of the ACF. Consider the recommendation of the ACF
Stakeholders in its Sustainable Water Management Plan regarding an
ACF transboundary water management institution as this organization
is developed.1
12. Regional Water Plan Use
The State Water Plan specifies that Regional Water Plans are to guide decisions
regarding permitting. The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council
understands that this Regional Water Plan provides a valuable regional perspective
and that it will be an important source of information for EPD and stakeholders. The
Regional Water Plan (and the resource assessments developed for regional water
planning) are just one source of information that can be used in the regulatory
process. EPD’s permit decisions should continue to be based on the full existing
framework of laws, rules, and guidance. Permit decisions should continue to rest
upon consideration of the body of detailed information provided by an applicant. The
Council expects that communications with permit applicants will be informed by the
applicant's familiarity with the contents of this adopted Regional Water Plan and the
ways in which the proposed activity addresses this Plan’s provisions.
