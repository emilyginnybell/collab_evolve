Implementing Water Management Practices
Local governments/utilities and
other permittees/water users,
along with citizens (through water
conservation), will be primarily
responsible for implementing the
regional plan. The state (including
EPD, DCA, regional commissions
and other partnering agencies) can
improve the planning process
through various data collection and
monitoring practices recommended
by the Council. The Middle
Ocmulgee Council suggested initial,
short-term (next 5 years), and longterm
(5 years and beyond) actions
for the recommended priority
management practices.
Implementation timeframes for
additional management practices
are to be determined by local
governments/utility/permittees
based on needs identified in
detailed local master plans.
Section 7. Implementing Water
Management Practices
This section presents the Middle Ocmulgee
Council’s strategy for the implementation of the
water management practices identified in Section
6. The State Water Plan identified that Regional
Water Plans will be primarily implemented by the
various water users in the respective regions.
This section describes the suggested roles and
responsibilities of the various implementing
parties, as well as the fiscal implications of their
management practices.
7.1 Implementation Schedule and
Roles of Responsible Parties
The implementation schedule and roles of
responsible parties for priority management
practices to address Resource Assessment gaps
or existing regulations are detailed in Table 7-1.
The time frame for implementation has only been
identified for the priority management practices
detailed in Table 6-1. The Council recommends
that time frames for implementing additional
voluntary management practices be determined by affected water users/entities,
based on the type of projects selected to address specific needs following detailed
analysis conducted by local entities. Implementation of infrastructure projects, such
as construction of a new reservoir or expansion of a wastewater treatment facility,
often require much longer times and cannot be easily compared to implementation of
ongoing programmatic measures, such as stormwater or water conservation
education programs. The Council’s recommended management practices, if
implemented, will work toward preventing or addressing potential future gaps and
meeting the Council’s goals. The Council advocates that the recommended
management practices be reviewed and updated as necessary in subsequent 5-year
plan updates, based on newly available data, information, and implementation
results.

7. Implementing Water Management Practices
7.2 Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management
Practices
The following sub-sections discuss planning level cost estimates and potential
funding sources and options. Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan
hinges on the ability of the state and local governments to fund the needed
implementation actions.
7.2.1 Planning Level Cost Estimates
Table 7-2 describes the fiscal implications of the priority management practices.
Cost estimates for implementation are included to the extent possible, based on
possible implementation unit (per capita, per study, per MGD of plant capacity, etc.).
The table is designed so that local governments/jurisdictions or other
permittees/water users can estimate budget requirements for the implementation of
the recommended management practices.
The planning level cost information shown in Table 7-2 is based upon cost guidance
prepared by EPD in April 2011 (“EPD Supplemental Guidance”). Neither the
guidance nor the cost estimates shown in the following tables have been updated.
Accordingly, the values shown below should only be used as a general guide.
Specific costs should be further evaluated and updated before being relied upon.
7.2.2 Funding Sources and Options
The ability of the responsible parties to successfully implement the management
practices identified in this plan depends on the availability of funding. It is essential
that funding mechanisms be identified, both at the state and permittee/user level to
support the long-term implementation of Regional Water Plans. Affected parties in
the region will be responsible for determining the best combination of funding
sources/options for implementing applicable management practices.
For local governments/utilities, water and sewer rates can be designed to provide a
steady revenue stream to support implementation of actions. Other potential
sources of funding for local governments and utilities can include general funds
raised through property taxes or service fees and grants. Bonds or other loan
options (such as loans from the GEFA) can provide up-front funding for required onetime
investments, but must be repaid through user charges or other recurring
revenues.
It is not likely that the costs of implementation can be supported by non-rate
revenues in many communities. Grants are only available in limited quantities and
under certain conditions, and sources of ongoing revenues such as general
government tax receipts and sales tax proceeds are often already over committed.
As a result, most communities may need to reflect most implementation costs in their
operating budgets and recover these costs through water and sewer or stormwater
user charges.
One existing program worth mentioning is DCA’s “WaterFirst.” program. WaterFirst
communities receive discounts on interest rates for loans. The program is a

voluntary partnership between local governments, state agencies, and other
organizations working together to increase the quality of life in communities through
the wise management and protection of water resources. It promotes a proactive
approach to water resources that makes the connection between land use and water
quality and quantity, which is consistent with the Council’s goal. Details of this
program can be found on the DCA website1.
For agricultural (farmers) or industrial permittees (industries or businesses), the
sources of funding include investment by the individual or business, grants, and/or
incentive programs. The Council and stakeholders in the Middle Ocmulgee Region
have identified that creation of new or expansion of existing incentive programs can
encourage implementation of demand management practices.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans
The update of the Regional Water Plan builds upon the knowledge base of previous
planning efforts by the Council as well as state and local governments and utilities.
Existing water- and wastewater-related plans and information sources are discussed
in Section 6 and in Supplemental Documents: Technical Memorandum - Demand
Management Practices (May 2011) and Technical Memorandum - Management
Practices Selection (May 2011). Where possible, local planned projects and/or
successful management practices are considered in the development of this plan. No
known major conflicts between this regional plan and other plans have been
identified. The Council encourages continuing alignment with all local and regional
efforts for update of future regional plans. Coordinated environmental planning is
recognized as a priority management practice, so that recommendations in the
Regional Water Plan can be incorporated in other major regional or local planning,
such as comprehensive land use plans, transportation plans, or local master plans.
Some differences exist in planning timing or cycles. Local comprehensive plans are
typically prepared for a 20-year planning horizon and complete or partial update of
the comprehensive plan can be prepared every 5 years. Water and wastewater
master plans and capital improvement plans are typically conducted for a 20- to 30-
year planning horizon. Georgia’s investor-owned utilities (Georgia Power, Atlanta
Gas Light Company and Atmos Energy) forecast future demand and develop
comprehensive plans for a 10-year planning horizon for supply and demand
management for their service territories under the Guidance of the Georgia Public
Service Commission (PSC). This Regional Water Plan has a 35-year planning
horizon to allow major water supply needs and their long-term impacts on water
7-11
MIDDLE OCMULGEE
June 2017
7. Implementing Water Management Practices
resources to be evaluated. The differences in planning horizons indicate that the
projects identified in local plans may not completely address the resource gaps
identified in this Regional Water Plan. However, the potential trends and issues
identified by this plan can be used to guide decision making by both local
governments and state agencies to avert potential negative impacts on water
resources in the region.
The Council also recognizes that specific funding needs to be set aside for
continuation of regional water planning, implementation, and Council activities.
Without available funding, the future role of the Council is unknown. The
implementation of Regional Water Plans largely depends on the availability of
funding.
7.4 Recommendations to the State
The Council recommends the following actions by the state that support
implementation of the Regional Water Plan (Table 7-4). The recommendations
include additional data collection and modeling needs for improving future regional
water planning efforts.
Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State
Public
Education and
Outreach
Develop an outreach program to feature the Middle Ocmulgee Region’s
abundant water resources to promote future economic growth.
Develop regional education materials for use and customization by local
entities.
Policy
Continue to study and evaluate current instream flow policy. Consider
alternative minimum instream flow policy such as stream-specific instream
flow values instead of the current monthly 7Q10 requirement (especially
for ecologically sensitive streams). Encourage state or federal funding for
minimum instream flow research that includes a pilot stream-specific study
in each of the river basin or planning region, beginning with streams
designated as DNR high priority streams, other ecologically sensitive
streams, or streams predicted to fall short of instream flow target in other
water planning regions. These studies should be used to establish an
updated DNR instream flow policy for all similar streams in that basin or
region. These studies should be completed before the next regional water
planning cycle.
Continue the current adaptive management and instream flow strategy for
permitting additional water supply reservoirs in the state (all regions).
Evaluate future nutrient policy based on analysis of additional monitoring
and data for nitrogen levels in Lake Jackson and its watersheds and the
impacts of elevated nutrient loadings.

Additional
Data
(Surface
Water)
Add planning nodes for the Surface Water Availability Model for the
Ocmulgee-Oconee-Altamaha Basin. Potential locations can include a
planning node below Macon area discharges (priority) and on major
unregulated tributaries of the Ocmulgee River such as Towaliga River and
Echeconnee Creek. Synthetic/ simulated streamflow using the long-term
streamflow data from the Macon stage and other downstream short-term
record gages can be considered if long-term monitoring data is not
available.
Evaluate minimum instream flow and unimpaired flow assumptions in the
Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment. Evaluate and better
integrate “critical (minimum instream flow) conditions” in Surface Water
Availability and Surface Water Quality Resource Assessment models for
the future Regional Water Plan Update. Coordinate and ensure
consistency for period of records used for all Resource Assessments.
Additional
Data
(Water
Quality)
Conduct additional monitoring on segments of streams predicted to have
exceeded DO assimilative capacity in the future Resource Assessment
(full permit limits assumptions) and evaluate possible causes before
determining actions to correct the potential impairment.
Encourage further research on emerging contaminants.
Conduct additional monitoring on nutrient loadings in Lake Jackson and its
watersheds and evaluate the impacts of elevated nutrient loadings,
especially nitrogen.
Funding
Identify long-term funding mechanism, beyond grants, to assist
responsible parties with implementation.
Identify a mechanism to allow for ongoing Middle Ocmulgee Council input
between the 5-year updates and during implementation of this plan.
Coordination
Coordinate with USGS regarding its 5-year water use data collection
efforts so these data can be aligned with other EPD data reporting efforts
and used for future regional planning purposes.
Coordinate local watershed monitoring efforts with regional or state
monitoring efforts and make better use of the data collected by local
entities.
