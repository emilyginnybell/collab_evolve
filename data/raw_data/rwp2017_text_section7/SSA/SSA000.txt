Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices
This section presents the Suwannee-Satilla Council’s
estimated timeframes for the implementation of the
water management practices identified in Section 6.
Schedules for implementation, in addition to the early
step(s) required to initiate implementation of a given
practice, are presented for both short- and long-term
actions. The Suwannee-Satilla Council has defined
short-term as 2015 to 2025 and long-term as 2025 to
2050. As the State Water Plan provides, this Plan will
be primarily implemented by the various water users
in the region; therefore, the Suwannee-Satilla Council
has described the roles and responsibilities of the
implementing parties as well as the fiscal implications
of the practices.
The Council also emphasizes that the implementation
of recommended management practices are
predicated on a number of planning assumptions
and/or may be impacted by unanticipated or currently
unknown factors including: projected growth of
population, industry, agricultural and energy needs;
data sets and assumptions related to water use, water
withdrawals and returns; data regarding water quality
and watershed models; rules and regulations
regarding water resource use and management; and
Resource Assessment tools for surface water
availability, surface water quality, and groundwater
availability. Consequently, significant changes or departures from these planning
assumptions, forecasts, and Resource Assessment tools may require a modification
of the recommended management practices, the implementation schedule, and/or the
implementing entities/affected stakeholders. Future planning efforts should confirm
current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the
conclusions reached during this round of planning.
7.1. Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible
Parties
Table 7-1 ties the resource shortfalls and the needs specified by the Council and the
corresponding management practices detailed in Table 6-1 to the parties who will
implement those practices. This table also describes the timeframe for implementation
and the specific steps required for implementation.
Summary
Implementation of the
Suwannee-Satilla Regional
Water Plan will be primarily
by various water users and
wastewater utilities in the
region. The most cost
effective and more readily
implemented management
practices will be prioritized
for short-term implementation
via an incremental and
adaptive approach. If
resource needs are not met
and/or gaps are not closed,
then more costly and
complex management
practices will be pursued.
As new information becomes
available, it is important the
Plan remain a living
document and be updated to
incorporate new findings.

Notes:
1Seek to reduce frequency and severity of human impacts to 7Q10 low flow conditions in the region, which are associated with agricultural water use in portions of the
Suwannee-Satilla Region. Focus on surface water permit holders and new surface water permit requests in Satilla Watershed [(Atkinson, Bacon, Brantley, Coffee, Irwin,
Pierce, and Ware Counties (Atkinson Gap)], Alapaha Watershed [Atkinson, Ben Hill, Berrien, Echols, Irwin, Lanier, Lowndes, Ti ft, and Turner Counties (Statenville and
Jennings Gaps)], and Withlacoochee Watershed [(Berrien, Brooks, Cook, Lowndes, Tift, and Turner Counties (Pinetta Gap)].
2Coordinate gap closure with the following regional councils: Altamaha (Wilcox County), Lower Flint-Ochlockonee (Colquitt, Worth Counties), Upper Flint (Crisp County).
3Additional industrial wastewater capacity may be needed. EPD to update and refine discharge limit databases to confirm flow and quality assumptions.

7.2. Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management
Practices
The following subsections discuss planning level cost estimates for the water
management practices selected by the Suwannee-Satilla Council and potential
funding sources and options. Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan
is highly dependent on the ability of state and local governments, water providers, and
utilities to fund the needed implementation actions.
Planning Level Cost Estimates
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for each management practice as shown
in Table 7-2 using planning guidance documents, the knowledge base of previous
state and utility planning efforts, and other sources of information, as listed below. The
guidance documents and sources used to inform the planning level cost information
in Table 7-2 have not been updated. Accordingly, the values shown below should only
be used as a general guide. Specific costs should be further evaluated and updated
before being relied upon.
• Georgia EPD Supplemental Guidance for Planning Contractors: Water
Management Practice Cost Comparison dated March 2010 (Revised March
2011).
• Water Conservation Analysis Technical Memorandum to Supplement Council’s
Plan prepared by CDM Smith for Georgia EPD draft dated July 2011.
• CDM Water Supply Cost Estimation Study prepared for the South Florida
Water Management District dated February 2007.
• EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control Practices – Preliminary
Report dated February 5, 2006.
• EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control dated January 2002.
• St. Johns River Water Management District Report titled Water Supply Needs
and Sources Assessment Alternative Water Supply Strategies Investigation,
Water Supply and Wastewater Systems Component Cost Information dated
1997 (Publication Number SJ97-SP3).
• Preliminary estimates of production well yields and costs from local licensed
well drillers in Georgia (Bishop Well and Pump Service and Grosch Irrigation
Company.)
• Georgia Geologic Survey Project Report 32 titled Irrigation Conservation
Practices Appropriate for the Southeastern United States. Prepared in
cooperation with the Georgia DNR, EPD.

• Groundwater Flow Modeling of the Coastal Plain Aquifer System of Georgia.
Draft Report completed for EPD as part of State of Georgia Groundwater
Resource Assessment.
• FY 2004 Sussex Conservation District Cover Crop Program Fact Sheet.
Sussex Conservation District, Georgetown, Delaware dated 2003.
• North Carolina State University Department of Forestry presentation titled
Costs of Forestry Best Management Practices in the South: A Review dated
2002.
• Recent bid tabulations (as of 2011) for wastewater treatment facilities.
The cost estimates are unit cost estimates where there is a lack of detail or specificity
about the management practice. For example, for an inter-basin transfer of water, the
cost is driven by the length and size of the pipeline and the quantity to be transferred.
If the connection locations and or the transfer quantity are not known, a unit cost per
mile of pipeline is given. Where there is detail about the management practice, unit
cost data were used to develop an approximate capital/programmatic cost. The capital
costs were adjusted to 2010 dollars using the Engineering News Record Cost Index.
In summary, some cost estimates are unit costs with different unit basis and some
costs are approximate capital costs. Therefore, each management practice was
assigned a cost (where applicable) rather than rolling up the costs into general
categories since they may not be additive. The cost information provided in this
document will be used to pursue loans, grants, and other funding options that can be
prioritized throughout the region.
Funding Sources and Options
Several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the
different management practices outlined in this Plan including:
• The State Revolving Fund Program
• Other State of Georgia Funding Programs
• State and Federal Grants
• Water/Wastewater System Revenues
• State and local government incentive programs
More details on potential loan and grant programs are provided for the management
practices in Table 7-2. Below is a list of some of the larger organizations and agencies
that provide funding for the types of management practices recommended in this Plan.
It is important to note that funding sources and opportunities change on a yearly basis.

7.3. Alignment with Other Plans
The Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Plan and management practices selection process
were based on identifying and supporting existing policy, planning, and projects. Local
comprehensive plans, planned and/or permitted projects were relied upon in
developing the Regional Water Plan. This approach is tailored to maintain consistency
with, and to maximize support for, locally driven water resource management
decisions. The Suwannee-Satilla Council did identify potential challenges associated
with both the cost and technical issues that the region may face; especially regarding
water and wastewater needs for both new and aging infrastructure. In addition,
addressing existing surface water gaps must be accomplished in a manner that does
not cause adverse impacts to local water users and local governments.
The challenges of funding Plan recommendations and addressing future technical and
regulatory issues is especially difficult for smaller towns and utilities, agricultural water
uses, and small businesses that rely on natural resources. The successful
implementation of the Regional Water Plan will be dependent on the principles of
support and leadership by state agencies, in a collaborative setting, utilizing incentives
and financial assistance to the extent possible.
7.4. Recommendations to the State
The Suwannee-Satilla Council supports the concept of regional water resource
planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water
users, water providers, industry, business, and affected stakeholders. Local
representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs.
The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support
7. Implementing Water Management

SUWANNEE-SATILLA
7-34
locally focused water resource planning. This Plan should be viewed as a living,
iterative document and the State should focus on the following principles:
Education, Incentives, Collaboration, Cooperation, Enabling, Supporting
The Suwannee-Satilla Council is sensitive to unintended consequences if Plan
recommendations become mandates or infringe upon private property rights. The
State must help balance Plan recommendations with assessing measurable progress
toward Plan implementation. If additional rules or other administrative or regulatory
actions are deemed necessary, the State should work with Councils to help ensure
workable solutions.
The following specific recommendations to the State are provided to help aid in the
successful implementation of the Plan.
Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)
• Consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long-term
commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Plan
recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and
analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and
help provide funding, permitting, and technical support to address gaps and
water resource needs.
• Work with EPD’s Agricultural Water Metering Program, as well as other
partners, including but not limited to, the University of Georgia and the Georgia
Department of Agriculture, to improve agricultural water use data collection and
management. This effort would focus on refining source(s) of supply for
multiple irrigation sources, continuing to assess data on crop water
requirements, evaluating the effects of farm ponds on direct irrigation
withdrawals and the hydrologic cycle, and further research on crop
consumptive use. This data in turn should be coordinated with Resource
Assessment tools to ensure accurate simulation of any gaps and assumptions.
• Support completion, maintenance and improvement of the Agricultural Water
Use Measurement Program, which is aimed at cost effectively collecting
agricultural water use data across the State, and integrating cooperative
arrangements with the private sector and partnerships with other State
agencies. This program is a vital component to helping the State and regions
effectively manage and utilize water resources.
• Work with the Southern Georgia Regional Commission to expand water quality
monitoring of tributaries on the State’s 303(d) list and tributaries identified as
having little or no dissolved oxygen assimilative capacity. Develop a new

dissolved oxygen standard that reflects the naturally low concentrations in
blackwater streams that are prevalent in this area.
• Focus funding support and permitting assistance to projects and programs
aimed at addressing gap areas. Where possible, leverage federal funds to help
support and expedite project implementation.
• Consider collaborative approaches to collecting more standardized water use
data and improving data on water demands. This would include continued
improvement and updating databases used in the planning process. It would
also involve working with the Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia
Association of County Commissioners, and other relevant stakeholders to
improve water use information.
• Working with Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, examine opportunities
to improve coordination among water providers and users and create
incentives to maximize existing infrastructure and coordinated operations.
• Continue to engage in dialogue and data-sharing with the States of Florida and
South Carolina regarding current and forecasted groundwater use. South
Georgia, North Florida, and South Carolina rely on the Floridan Aquifer to meet
water supply needs and it is in EPD’s best interest to include the most accurate
available information on growth and groundwater use in both states in the
Resource Assessment modeling.
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA)
• Meeting forecasted water supply needs will require stable and flexible funding
sources to assist water users and water and wastewater utilities in meeting
forecasted needs. A stable GEFA financing source(s) should be provided for
necessary water supply, water and wastewater plant construction, and plant
upgrades to address current and future gaps.
Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC)
• Continue to support and fund the GFC Forestry Best Management Practices
Program. Providing education and incentives to control erosion and
segmentation will help the region prevent/address TMDL listed segments,
reduce nutrient loadings, and support wetland areas. This will have the benefit
of helping sustaining baseflow conditions of streams and water quality.
Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC)
GSWCC should continue to provide leadership and locally focused efforts in the
following programs:
7. Implementing Water Management
Practices
June 2017
SUWANNEE-SATILLA
7-36
• Continue education and outreach associated with Urban Erosion and Sediment
Control program including certification of individuals involved in land disturbing
activities and on-site implementation of erosion, sedimentation, and pollution
control plans. This will help address the water quality needs of the region.
• Continue education and outreach efforts to agricultural interests to inform
farmers of available technologies and funding sources to make more efficient
use of water resources without incurring hardship.
• Support Georgia Agricultural Conservation Incentive program, which provides
funding support to help implement conservation practices. Funding for this
program is essential to help implement conservation measures, especially in
the regional watersheds where there are surface water gaps.
• Provide incentives to restore wetlands and historically drained hardwood
swamps and other natural retention areas. Restoration of these features will
replenish sources of headwaters by retaining surface runoff and releasing it
over a longer period to offset loss of baseflows between rain events, while also
providing additional recharge to surficial aquifers.
Office of State Planning and Budget (OPB)
• Obtain population census data and compare to population forecasts to track
trends in the accuracy of population projections.
• Revise population forecasts and support ongoing state-wide planning.
Department of Community Affairs (DCA)
• Identify and encourage local governments to integrate Regional Water Plan
management practices with land use and water quality/quantity nexuses into
their comprehensive planning efforts.
• Continue to promote coordinated environmental planning.
In-State Universities and Colleges
• Research the percent loss and consumption of irrigation water applied to crops
to estimate how much of the water that is applied to a crop is lost to
evaporation, runs off into surface waters, and infiltrates to groundwater.
• Research varieties of crops that require less water and are more drought
resistant.
• Research the impacts of development and various land uses on aquifer
recharge areas.
7. Implementing Water Management
Practices
June 2017

SUWANNEE-SATILLA
• Research the effectiveness of management practices to control non-point
source pollutants such as sediment, fecal coliform, and nutrients in stormwater
runoff from different land uses including urban and rural development,
agriculture, and silviculture.
• Research the role played by wetlands in abating runoff flows from storm
events, providing source water for surface water features, and treating surface
water quality. Evaluate the benefits of restoring previously drained and/or
developed wetlands to their natural state.
Georgia Department of Agriculture (DOA)
• Provide technical information and participate in needed studies to better
characterize agricultural water uses and quantification of shortages to low flow
conditions.
• Assist with outreach and education of agricultural users to obtain greater
understanding of surface water resource limitations, both quality and quantity,
and to help improve the implementation rate of management practices. Assist
EPD and other state agencies in coordinating accomplishment of the above
goals with the Georgia Farm Bureau.
Georgia Department of Natural Resources [Coastal Resources Division (CRD)
and Wildlife Resources Division (WRD)]
• Continue to monitor resources and help sustain, enhance, protect and
conserve Georgia’s natural, historic, and cultural resources.
• Provide technical and ecosystem information to help support state water
planning needs.
