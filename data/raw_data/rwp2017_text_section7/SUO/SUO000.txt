Section 7. Implementing Water
Management Practices
This section presents the Savannah-Upper
Ogeechee Council’s roadmap for the
implementation of the water management
practices identified in Section 6. As the State
Water Plan provides, this plan will be primarily
implemented by the various water users in the
region. This section describes the suggested
roles and responsibilities of the implementing
parties as well as the fiscal implications of the
practices.
7.1. Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible
Parties
The implementation schedule and roles of responsible parties for priority
management practices (management practices selected to address Resource
Assessment gaps or existing regulations) are detailed in Table 7-1. The timeframe
for implementation has only been identified for the priority management practices
detailed in Table 6-1A. Anticipated timeframes for implementation actions are
defined as short-term (next 5 years) and long-term (5 years and beyond).
The Council recommends that timeframes for implementing other recommended
management practices (Table 6-1B) be determined by affected water users/entities,
based on the type of projects selected to address specific needs and following
detailed analysis conducted by local entities. Implementation of infrastructure
projects, such as construction of a new reservoir or expansion of a wastewater
treatment facility, often require much longer times and cannot be easily compared to
implementation of ongoing programmatic measures, such as stormwater or water
conservation education programs. The Council’s recommended management
practices, if implemented, will work toward preventing or closing potential future gaps
and meeting regional goals. The Council advocates that the recommended
management practices be reviewed and updated as necessary in subsequent 5-year
plan updates, based on newly available data, information, and implementation
results.
Primary responsibility for
implementing the regional plan will
be at the local level; however, State
agencies are requested to assist
with implementation. The Council
suggested short-term and longterm
actions for the recommended
priority management practices.
Implementation schedules for
additional management practices
are to be determined by local
governments, utilities and permit
holders based on needs identified in
detailed local master plans.

7.2. Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management
Practices
The following sub-sections discuss planning-level cost estimates and potential
funding sources and options. Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan
hinges on the ability of the State and local governments to fund the needed
implementation actions.
7.2.1. Planning Level Cost Estimates
Table 7-2 describes the fiscal implications of the priority management practices.
Cost estimates for implementation are included to the extent possible, based on
possible implementation unit (per capita, per study, per MGD of plant capacity, etc.).
The table is designed so that local governments/jurisdictions or other permit holders
and water users can estimate budget requirements for the implementation of the
recommended management practices.
The planning level cost information shown in Table 7-2 is based upon cost guidance
prepared by EPD in April 2011 (“EPD Supplemental Guidance”). Neither the
guidance nor the cost estimates shown in the following tables have been updated.
Accordingly, the values shown below should only be used as a general guide.
Specific costs should be further evaluated and updated before being relied upon.
7.2.2. Funding Sources and Options
The ability of the responsible parties to successfully implement the management
practices identified in this plan depends on the availability of funding. It is essential
that a funding mechanism be identified, both at the State and local level to support
the long-term implementation of the Regional Water Plan. Affected parties in the
region will be responsible for determining the best combination of funding
sources/options for implementing applicable management practices.
For local governments/utilities, water and sewer rates can be designed to provide a
steady revenue stream to support implementation of certain actions. Other potential
sources of funding for local governments and utilities can include general funds
raised through property taxes or service fees, bonds, loans (such as loans from the
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority), and grants. One existing program worth
mentioning is DCA’s “WaterFirst”. WaterFirst communities receive discounts on
interest rates for loans. The program is a voluntary partnership between local
governments, State agencies, and other organizations working together to increase
the quality of life in communities through the wise management and protection of
water resources. It promotes a proactive approach to water resources that makes
the connection between land use and water quality and quantity, which is consistent
with the Council’s goal. Details of this program can be found on the DCA website.1

7. Implementing Water Management Practices
7.3. Alignment with Other Plans
This update of the Regional Water Plan builds upon the knowledge base of previous
planning efforts by the Council as well as State and local governments and utilities.
Existing water- and wastewater-related plans and information sources are listed in
the supplemental document Existing Plans for Savannah-Upper Ogeechee Water
Planning Region (May 2011), which can be found on the Council’s website.
Where appropriate, local planned projects and successful management practices
were considered in the development of this plan. No known major conflicts between
this regional plan and other plans have been identified. The Council encourages
continuing alignment with all local and regional efforts (including those for adjacent
watersheds and states) for future updates of regional plans. Coordinated
environmental planning is recognized as a priority management practice, so that
recommendations in the Regional Water Plan can be incorporated in other major
regional or local planning, such as comprehensive land use plans, transportation
plans, or local master plans.
Some differences exist in planning timing or cycle; for example, local comprehensive
plans are typically prepared for a 20-year planning horizon; complete or partial
update of the comprehensive plan can be prepared every 5 years. Water and
wastewater master plans and capital improvement plans are typically conducted for a
20- to 30-year planning horizon. This Regional Water Plan has a 35-year planning
horizon to allow major water supply needs and their long-term impacts on water
resources to be evaluated. The differences in planning horizons indicate that the
projects identified in local plans may not completely address the resource gaps
identified in this Regional Water Plan. However, the potential trends and issues
identified by this plan can be used to guide decision making by both local
governments and state agencies to avert potential negative impacts on water
resources in the region.
The Council also recognizes that specific funding needs to be set aside for
continuation of regional water planning, implementation, and Council activities.
Without available funding, the future role of the Council is unknown. The
implementation of Regional Water Plans largely depends on the availability of
funding.

7.4. Recommendations to the State
The Savannah-Upper Ogeechee Council recommends the following actions by the
EPD to support implementation of the Regional Water Plan (Table 7-3). These
recommendations include additional funding, data collection, policy, coordination and
public education and outreach necessary for improving future regional water
planning efforts.
Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State
Funding
· Identify long-term funding options and a coordinating agency(s)
to assist responsible parties with Regional Water Plan
implementation.
· Coordinate with EPD and develop additional funding to further
implement and improve the agricultural metering program.
· Recommend State and Federal funding to support further
optimization studies for the USACE lakes to include: minimum
release flows and pool elevation modifications (Savannah River
Basin Comprehensive Study Phase II)
· Identify funding or support for developing Stormwater Utilities
for small water utilities that lack necessary resources to
implement on their own.
Additional Data
(Surface Water)
· Engage USACE regarding a feasibility study to evaluate the
costs/benefits of raising lake levels to preserve storage for
water supply and provide flows for drought relief downstream.
· Further develop agricultural use metering program and monitor
withdrawal from the nursery and agricultural industries in the
region by reading meters, collecting and compiling that data on
a regular basis, with consideration given to the implementing of
a self-reporting practice.
· Evaluate instream flow and unimpaired flow assumptions in the
Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment. Consider
pilot site-specific instream flow studies in the Ogeechee Basin
(at locations predicted to have instream flow shortage). In
combination with a low flow monitoring program and an
agricultural use metering program, confirm the magnitude and
frequency of predicted gaps.
· Consider adding an additional planning node(s) in the Upper
Ogeechee Basin for further refinement of the Surface Water
Availability Resource Assessment model.
· Update Surface Water Availability and Surface Water Quality
Resource Assessment models based on the results of the
studies for future Regional Water Plan update.
· Provide and present future updated information by watershed,
rather than by Council boundaries.

Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State
Additional Data
(Water Quality)
Continue monitoring on segments of streams predicted to exceed DO
assimilative capacity; monitor rate of DO depletion and evaluate
possible causes before determining actions to correct the potential
impairment.
Technical
Support (Water
Quality)
Support and facilitate ongoing implementation of the Savannah Harbor
5R plan approved by USEPA. EPD’s assistance in coordinating,
facilitating, and providing technical support during implementation of the
5R Plan is needed to improve dissolved oxygen conditions in the lower
Savannah River.
Policy
· Continue to study and evaluate current instream flow policy.
· Encourage State funding for minimum instream flow and
unimpaired flow research.
· Request EPD assistance in streamlining the reservoir
permitting process.
· Maintain the existing ban of interbasin transfers that was
incorporated in the 2001 statue creating the Metropolitan North
Georgia Water Planning District and expressly prohibiting the
interbasin transfer of water into the 15 county metropolitan
Atlanta area. Therefore, any transfer of Tennessee or
Savannah River Basin water to the Metro region has been and
is currently prohibited by law.
· Consider designating the Southeast Georgia Experiment
Station at Midville as an irrigation research center similar to the
Stripling Center in Camilla to provide modelling data that is
more specific to the region.
Coordination
· Continue to coordinate with SCDHEC and SCDNR on
Savannah River water resources.
· Coordinate with USGS regarding its 5-year water use data
collection efforts so these data can be aligned with other EPD
data reporting efforts and used for future regional planning
purposes.
· Use UGA Extension as the preferred channel to disseminate
information to the Agricultural Community due to its reputation
and capability.
Public Education
and Outreach
Develop regional education materials for use and customization by local
entities that can be tailored for specific audiences (i.e., community vs.
industrial vs. agricultural organizations).
The Council specifically requests that EPD, working in conjunction with the USACE
and through the Savannah River Basin Comprehensive Study update process,
evaluate adaptive management techniques and potential revisions to operating
protocols that would minimize the use of the available conservation storage.

SAVANNAH- UPPER OGEECHEE

Currently, the USACE is working with the States of Georgia and South Carolina to
secure funding for the next phase of Comprehensive Study update. Topics to be
investigated with the Comprehensive Study update are recommended to include:
1. Management of the Savannah River Basin in a more adaptive manner by
releasing less water from the Thurmond dam if adequate river flows are occurring
downstream. Generally speaking, it is in the best interest of all stakeholders
within the Savannah River Basin to keep the lakes as full as practical and as long
as practical, so that stored water is available to release in times of lower rainfall.
2. Evaluate potential revisions to the rule curves for Lakes Thurmond and Hartwell.
Evaluate whether the winter pool elevations could be beneficially raised.
3. Manage the USACE lakes more closely to the existing rule curves. Evaluate the
operational scenario where (a) downstream flow releases are reduced as soon
as the lakes drop below the rule curves for Lakes Hartwell and Thurmond, and
(b) reduce the range of lake level drop between trigger levels.
4. Consider further economic impact studies and protection of "the economic well
being" of the communities that have developed both around the USACE projects
and downstream in the basin as one of the goals of those projects.
5. Continue to evaluate the current minimum flow release below the Thurmond
dam.
6. Continue to evaluate the ecological impacts of any modifications to the
management operations strategy.
