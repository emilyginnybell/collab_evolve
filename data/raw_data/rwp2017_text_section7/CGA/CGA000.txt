 


Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices
This Section presents the Coastal Georgia Council’s estimated timeframes for the implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6. Schedules for implementation, in addition to the early step(s) required to initiate implementation of a given practice, are presented for both short- and long-term actions. The Coastal Georgia Council has defined short- term as years 2015 to 2025 and long-term as 2025 to 2050. As the State Water Plan provides, this Plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the region; therefore, the Coastal Georgia Council has described the roles and responsibilities of the implementing parties as well as the fiscal implications of the practices.

The Coastal Council also emphasizes that the implementation of recommended management practices are predicated on a number of planning assumptions and/or may be impacted by unanticipated or currently unknown factors including: projected growth of population, industry, agricultural and energy needs; shared resources with surrounding regions; future identification/proposal of a significant upstream water resource project; data sets and assumptions related to water use, water withdrawals and returns; data regarding water quality and watershed models; rules and regulations regarding water resource use and
management; and Resource Assessment tools for surface water availability, surface water quality, and groundwater availability. Consequently, significant changes or departures from these planning assumptions, forecasts, and Resource Assessment tools may require a modification of the recommended management practices, the implementation schedule, and/or the implementing entities/affected stakeholders. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning.

7.1.  Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible Parties
Table 7-1 ties the resource shortfalls and the needs specified by the Council and the corresponding management practices detailed in Table 6-1 to the parties who will implement those practices. This table also describes the timeframe for implementation and the specific steps required for implementation.

2The role/selection of specified practice in addressing current gaps and future forecasted needs in the gap areas requires additional data from the Bi-State Salt Water Intrusion Stakeholder Process between Georgia and South Carolina.
3Possible areas include: Effingham, Bulloch, Evans, Tattnall, Long, McIntosh, Glynn, and Camden Counties [(Effingham, Chatham Red Zone); [Bryan, Liberty Yellow Zones)]
4Additional industrial wastewater capacity may be needed. EPD to update and refine discharge limit databases to confirm flow and quality assumptions.
 


7.2 Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices
The following subsections discuss planning level cost estimates for the water management practices selected by the Coastal Council and potential funding sources and options. Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan is highly dependent on the ability of state and local governments, water providers, and utilities, to fund the needed implementation actions.

Planning Level Cost Estimates
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for each management practice as shown in Table 7-2 using planning guidance documents, the knowledge base of previous state and utility planning efforts, and other sources of information, as listed below. The guidance documents and sources used to inform the planning level cost information in Table 7-2 have not been updated. Accordingly, the values shown below should only be used as a general guide.

The cost estimates are unit cost estimates where there is a lack of detail or specificity about the management practice. For example, for an inter-basin transfer of water, the cost is driven by the length and size of the pipeline and the quantity to be transferred. If the connection locations and/or the transfer quantity are not known, a unit cost per mile of pipeline is given. Where there is detail about the management practice, unit cost data were used to develop an approximate capital/programmatic cost. The capital costs were adjusted to 2010 dollars using the Engineering News Record Cost Index. In summary, some cost estimates are unit costs with different unit basis and some costs are approximate capital costs. Therefore, each management practice was assigned a cost (where applicable) rather than rolling up the costs into general categories since they may not be additive. The cost information provided in this document will be used to pursue loans, grants, and other funding options that can be prioritized throughout the region.

Funding Sources and Options
Several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the different management practices outlined in this Plan including:

• The State Revolving Fund Program administrated by GEFA
• Other State of Georgia Funding Programs
• State and Federal Grants
• Water/Wastewater System Revenues
• State and local government incentive programs

More details on potential loan and grant programs are provided for the management practices in Table 7-2. Below is a list of some of the larger organizations and agencies that provide funding for the types of management practices recommended in this Plan. It is important to note that funding sources and opportunities change on a yearly basis.

7.3.  Alignment with Other Plans
The Coastal Council’s Plan and management practices selection process was based on identifying and supporting existing policy, planning, and projects. Local comprehensive plans, planned and/or permitted projects were relied upon in developing the Regional Water Plan. This approach is tailored to maintain consistency with, and to maximize support for, locally driven water resource management
 


decisions. The Coastal Council did identify potential challenges associated with both the cost and technical issues that the region may face; especially regarding water and wastewater needs for both new and aging infrastructure. In addition, addressing existing surface and groundwater gaps must be accomplished in a manner that does not cause adverse impacts to local water users and local governments.

Water resource decisions in the Coastal Georgia Region are affected by regulatory process related to Savannah River water quality and bi-state discussions regarding the Savannah River and salt water intrusion in the Savannah/Hilton Head region. The outcome of these discussions and potential recommendations or other decisions will have important implications for the Regional Water Plan and will need to be incorporated and/or reconciled with the Regional Water Plan as this information becomes available.

The challenges of funding Plan recommendations and addressing future technical and regulatory issues is especially difficult for smaller towns and utilities, agricultural water uses, and small businesses that rely on natural resources. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will be dependent on the principles of support and leadership by state agencies, in a collaborative setting, utilizing incentives and financial assistance to the extent possible.

7.4.  Recommendations to the State
The Coastal Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning.

The Coastal Council is sensitive to unintended consequences if Plan recommendations become mandates. The State must help balance Plan recommendations with assessing measurable progress toward Plan implementation. If additional rules or other administrative or regulatory actions are deemed necessary, the State should work with Councils to help ensure workable solutions.

The following specific recommendations to the State are provided to help aid in the successful implementation of the Plan.

Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)

• Consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long-term commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Plan recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and help provide funding, permitting and technical support to address gaps and water resource needs.
 

• Support and facilitate the continued implementation of the Savannah Harbor 5R plan that was approved by EPA in 2016. EPD’s assistance in coordinating, facilitating, and providing technical support during implementation of the 5R Plan is essential. The Coastal Council supports this process and has indicated that continued implementation of pollutant loading strategies (management practices) will continue to improve dissolved oxygen conditions in the lower Savannah River.

• Provide leadership, coordination, and technical support to continue stakeholder collaboration, coordination and implementation of management practices that will continue to improve the regional management of the Floridan aquifer, as outlined in this plan, and in conjunction with the Coastal Georgia Water & Wastewater Permitting Plan (CPP) that was recently updated in 2015. The Coastal Georgia Regional Water Plan provides recommended management practices that are in alignment with the CPP and that also continue to advance the adopted Vision and Goals of the Coastal Georgia Regional Water Planning Council. A continued stakeholder process is encouraged, including on-going monitoring and reporting which are foundational to implementing a plan based on the principles of adaptive management. Consequently, EPD will also need to continue to serve as a “bridge” between the State water planning process and this stakeholder process.

• Work with EPD’s Agricultural Water Metering Program, as well as other partners, including but not limited to, the University of Georgia and the Georgia Department of Agriculture to improve agricultural water use data collection and management. This effort would focus on refining source(s) of supply for multiple irrigation sources, continuing to assess data on crop water requirements, evaluating the effects of farm ponds on direct irrigation withdrawals and the hydrologic cycle, and further research on crop consumptive use. This data in turn should be coordinated with Resource Assessment tools to ensure accurate simulation of any gaps and assumptions.

• Support completion, maintenance and improvement of the Agricultural Water Use Measurement Program, which is aimed at cost effectively collecting agricultural water use data across the State, and integrating cooperative arrangements with the private sector and partnerships with other State agencies. This program is a vital component to helping the State and regions effectively manage and utilize water resources.

• Focus funding support and permitting assistance to projects and programs aimed at addressing gap areas. Where possible, leverage federal funds to help support and expedite project implementation.

• Consider collaborative approaches to collecting more standardized water use data and improving data on water demands. This would include continued improvement and updating databases used in the planning process. It would
 


also involve working with the Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia Association of County Commissioners, and other relevant stakeholders to improve water use information.

• Working with Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, examine opportunities to improve coordination among water providers and users and create incentives to maximize existing infrastructure and coordinated operations.

• Track, support, and participate in South Carolina water planning efforts. Successful planning in the Coastal Region and Savannah-Upper Ogeechee Region will benefit from constructive and collaborative engagement of South Carolina on issues associated with the current and future use of the Savannah River for both water supply and wastewater assimilation. Sustainable use and management of the Savannah River is critical to the social and economic future of both Georgia and South Carolina.

• Continue to engage in dialogue and data-sharing with the States of Florida and South Carolina regarding current and forecasted groundwater use. South Georgia, North Florida, and South Carolina rely on the Floridan aquifer to meet water supply needs and it is in EPD’s best interest to include the most accurate available information on growth and groundwater use in both states in the Resource Assessment modeling.

Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA)

• Meeting forecasted water supply needs will require stable and flexible funding sources to assist water users and water and wastewater utilities in meeting forecasted needs. A stable GEFA financing source(s) should be maintained for necessary water supply, water and wastewater plant construction, and plant upgrades to address current and future gaps.

Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC)

• Continue to support and fund the GFC Forestry Best Management Practices Program. Providing education and incentives to control erosion and sedimentation will help the region prevent/address TMDL listed segments, reduce nutrient loadings, and support wetland areas. This will have the benefit of helping sustain baseflow conditions of streams and water quality.

Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC)

GSWCC should continue to provide leadership and locally focused efforts in the following programs:

• Continue education and outreach associated with Urban Erosion and Sediment Control program including certification of individuals involved in land disturbing
 


activities and on-site implementation of erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plans. This will help address the water quality needs of the region.

• Continue education and outreach efforts to agricultural interests to inform farmers of available technologies and funding sources to make more efficient use of water resources without incurring hardship. Support Georgia Agricultural Conservation Incentive program, which provides funding support to help implement conservation practices. Funding for this program is essential to help implement conservation measures, especially in the regional watersheds where there are surface water gaps.

Office of State Planning and Budget (OPB)

• Obtain population census data and compare to population forecasts to track trends in the accuracy of population projections
• Revise population forecasts and support ongoing state-wide planning Department of Community Affairs (DCA)
• Identify and encourage local governments to integrate Regional Plan management practices with land use and water quality/quantity nexuses into their comprehensive planning efforts.
• Continue to promote coordinated environmental planning Georgia Department of Agriculture (DOA)
• Provide technical information and participate in needed studies to better characterize agricultural water uses and quantification of shortages to low flow conditions.

• Assist with outreach and education of agricultural uses to obtain greater understanding of surface water resource limitations, both quality and quantity, and to help improve the implementation rate of management practices. Assist EPD and other state agencies in coordinating with the Georgia Farm Bureau to accomplish the above goals.

Georgia Department of Natural Resources [Coastal Resources Division (CRD) and Wildlife Resources Division (WRD)]

• Continue to monitor resources and help sustain, enhance, protect and conserve Georgia’s natural, historic and cultural resources.

• Provide technical and ecosystem information to help support state water planning needs.
