identified for the priority management practices detailed in Table 6-1. The Council recommends detailed local master plans. that time frames for implementing additional voluntary management practices be determined by affected water users/entities, based on the type of projects selected to address specific needs following detailed analysis conducted by local entities.  Implementation of infrastructure projects, such as construction of a new reservoir or expansion of a wastewater treatment facility, often require much longer times and cannot be easily compared to implementation of ongoing programmatic measures, such as stormwater or water conservation education programs. The Council’s recommended management practices, if implemented, will work toward preventing or closing potential future gaps and meeting the Council’s goals.  The Council advocates that the recommended management practices be reviewed and updated as necessary in subsequent 5-year plan updates, based on newly available data, information, and implementation results.

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
7.2 Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices 
The following sub-sections discuss planning level cost estimates and potential funding sources and options.  Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan hinges on the ability of the state and local governments to fund the needed implementation actions. 
7.2.1 Planning Level Cost Estimates 
Table 7-2 describes the fiscal implications of the priority management practices. Cost estimates for implementation are included to the extent possible, based on possible implementation unit (per capita, per study, per MGD of plant capacity, etc.). The table is designed so that local governments/jurisdictions or other permittees/water users can estimate budget requirements for the implementation of the recommended management practices. 
7.2.2 Funding Sources and Options 
The ability of the responsible parties to successfully implement the management practices identified in this plan depends on the availability of funding.  It is essential that funding mechanisms be identified, both at the state and permittee/user level to support the long-term implementation of Regional Water Plans.  Affected parties in the region will be responsible for determining the best combination of funding sources/options for implementing applicable management practices. 
For local governments/utilities, water and sewer rates can be designed to provide a steady revenue stream to support implementation of actions.  Other potential sources of funding for local governments and utilities can include general funds raised through property taxes or service fees and grants.  Bonds or other loan options (such as loans from the GEFA) can provide up-front funding for required one­time investments, but must be repaid through user charges or other recurring revenues. 
It is not likely that the costs of implementation can be supported by non-rate revenues in many communities. Grants are only available in limited quantities and under certain conditions, and sources of ongoing revenues such as general government tax receipts and sales tax proceeds are often already over committed. As a result, most communities may need to reflect most implementation costs in their operating budgets and recover these costs through water and sewer or stormwater user charges.  
One existing program worth mentioning is DCA’s “WaterFirst.” program. WaterFirst communities receive discounts on interest rates for loans.  The program is a voluntary partnership between local governments, state agencies, and other organizations working together to increase the quality of life in communities through the wise management and protection of water resources.  It promotes a proactive approach to water resources that makes the connection between land use and water quality and quantity, which is consistent with the Council’s goal.  Details of this program can be found on the DCA website1 . 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
For agricultural (farmers) or industrial permittees (industries or businesses), the sources of funding include investment by the individual or business, grants, and/or incentive programs.  The Council and stakeholders in the Middle Ocmulgee Region have identified that creation of new or expansion of existing incentive programs can encourage implementation of demand management practices.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans 
The development of this Regional Water Plan builds upon the knowledge base of previous planning efforts by state and local governments and utilities.  Existing water- and wastewater-related plans and information sources are discussed in Section 6 and in Supplemental Documents: Technical Memorandum - Demand Management Practices (May 2011) and Technical Memorandum - Management Practices Selection (May 2011).  Where possible, local planned projects and/or successful management practices are considered in the development of this plan. No known major conflicts between this regional plan and other plans have been identified. The Council encourages continuing alignment with all local and regional efforts for update of future regional plans.  Coordinated environmental planning is recognized as a priority management practice, so that recommendations in the Regional Water Plan can be incorporated in other major regional or local planning, such as comprehensive land use plans, transportation plans, or local master plans. 
Some differences exist in planning timing or cycles. Local comprehensive plans are typically prepared for a 20-year planning horizon and complete or partial update of the comprehensive plan can be prepared every 5 years.  Water and wastewater master plans and capital improvement plans are typically conducted for a 20- to 30­year planning horizon.  Georgia’s investor-owned utilities (Georgia Power, Atlanta Gas Light Company and Atmos Energy) forecast future demand and develop comprehensive plans for a 10-year planning horizon for supply and demand management for their service territories under the Guidance of the Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC).  This Regional Water Plan has a 40-year planning horizon to allow major water supply needs and their long-term impacts on water 
MIDDLE OCMULGEE 


7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
resources to be evaluated.  The differences in planning horizons indicate that the projects identified in local plans may not completely address the resource gaps identified in this Regional Water Plan.  However, the potential trends and issues identified by this plan can be used to guide decision making by both local governments and state agencies to avert potential negative impacts on water resources in the region. 
The Council also recognizes that specific funding needs to be set aside for continuation of regional water planning, implementation, and Council activities. Without available funding, the future role of the Council is unknown.  The implementation of Regional Water Plans will largely depend on the availability of funding. 
7.4 Recommendations to the State 
The Council recommends the following actions by the state that support implementation of the Regional Water Plan (Table 7-4).  The recommendations include additional data collection and modeling needs for improving future regional water planning efforts. 
Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State  
Public Education and Outreach  Develop an outreach program to feature the Middle Ocmulgee Region’s abundant water resources to promote future economic growth. Develop regional education materials for use and customization by local entities.  
Policy  Continue to study and evaluate current instream flow policy.  Consider alternative minimum instream flow policy such as stream-specific instream flow values instead of the current monthly 7Q10 requirement (especially for ecologically sensitive streams). Encourage state or federal funding for minimum instream flow research that includes a pilot stream-specific study in each of the river basin or planning region, beginning with streams designated as DNR high priority streams, other ecologically sensitive streams, or streams predicted to fall short of instream flow target in other water planning regions.  These studies should be used to establish an updated DNR instream flow policy for all similar streams in that basin or region. These studies should be completed before the next regional water planning cycle. Continue the current adaptive management and instream flow strategy for permitting additional water supply reservoirs in the state (all regions).    
Evaluate future nutrient policy based on analysis of additional monitoring and data for nitrogen levels in Lake Jackson and its watersheds and the impacts of elevated nutrient loadings.  


7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State  
Additional Data (Surface Water)  Add planning nodes for the Surface Water Availability Model for the Ocmulgee-Oconee-Altamaha Basin.  Potential locations can include a planning node below Macon area discharges (priority) and on major unregulated tributaries of the Ocmulgee River such as Towaliga River and Echeconnee Creek.  Synthetic/ simulated streamflow using the long-term streamflow data from the Macon stage and other downstream short-term record gages can be considered if long-term monitoring data is not available.  
Evaluate minimum instream flow and unimpaired flow assumptions in the Surface Water Availability Resource Assessment.  Evaluate and better integrate “critical (minimum instream flow) conditions” in Surface Water Availability and Surface Water Quality Resource Assessment models for the future Regional Water Plan Update.  Coordinate and ensure consistency for period of records used for all Resource Assessments.  
Additional Data (Water Quality)  Conduct additional monitoring on segments of streams predicted to have exceeded DO assimilative capacity in the future Resource Assessment (full permit limits assumptions) and evaluate possible causes before determining actions to correct the potential impairment.  
Encourage further research on emerging contaminants.  
Conduct additional monitoring on nutrient loadings in Lake Jackson and its watersheds and evaluate the impacts of elevated nutrient loadings, especially nitrogen.     
Funding  Identify long-term funding mechanism, beyond grants, to assist responsible parties with implementation.  
Identify a mechanism to allow for ongoing Middle Ocmulgee Council input between the 5-year updates and during implementation of this plan.  
Coordination  Coordinate with USGS regarding its 5-year water use data collection efforts so these data can be aligned with other EPD data reporting efforts and used for future regional planning purposes.  
Coordinate local watershed monitoring efforts with regional or state monitoring efforts and make better use of the data collected by local entities.
