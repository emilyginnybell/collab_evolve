  7. Implementing Water Management Practices
Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices
This Section presents the Coastal Georgia Council’s estimated timeframes for the implementation of the water management practices identified in Section 6. Schedules for implementation, in addition to the early step(s) required to initiate implementation of a given practice, are presented for both short- and long-term actions. The Coastal Georgia Council has defined short-term as years 2010 to 2020 and long-term as 2020 to 2050. As the State Water Plan provides, this Plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the region; therefore, the Coastal Georgia Council has described the roles and responsibilities of the implementing parties as well as the fiscal implications of the practices.
The Coastal Council also emphasizes that the
implementation of recommended management
practices are predicated on a number of planning
assumptions and/or may be impacted by unanticipated
or currently unknown factors including: projected
growth of population, industry, agricultural and energy
needs; shared resources with surrounding regions;
future identification/proposal of a significant upstream
water resource project; data sets and assumptions
related to water use, water withdrawals and returns;
data regarding water quality and watershed models;
rules and regulations regarding water resource use and management; and Resource Assessment tools for surface water availability, surface water quality, and groundwater availability. Consequently, significant changes or departures from these planning assumptions, forecasts, and Resource Assessment tools may require a modification of the recommended management practices, the implementation schedule, and/or the implementing entities/affected stakeholders. Future planning efforts should confirm current assumptions and make necessary revisions and/or improvements to the conclusions reached during this round of planning.
7.1. Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible
Parties
Table 7-1 ties the resource shortfalls and the needs specified by the Council and the corresponding management practices detailed in Table 6-1 to the parties who will implement those practices. This table also describes the timeframe for implementation and the specific steps required for implementation.
 Summary
 Implementation of the Coastal Georgia Regional Water Plan will be primarily by various water users and wastewater utilities in the region. The most cost effective and more readily implemented management practices will be prioritized for short-term implementation via an incremental and adaptive approach. If resource needs are not met and/or gaps are not addressed, then more complex management practices will be pursued.
As new information becomes available, it is important the Plan remain a living document and be updated to incorporate new findings.

7.2 Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management
Practices
The following subsections discuss planning level cost estimates for the water management practices selected by the Coastal Council and potential funding sources and options. Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan is highly dependent on the ability of state and local governments, water providers, and utilities, to fund the needed implementation actions.
Planning Level Cost Estimates
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for each management practice as shown in Table 7-2 using planning guidance documents, the knowledge base of previous state and utility planning efforts, and other sources of information, as listed below:

 FY 2004 Sussex Conservation District Cover Crop Program Fact Sheet. Sussex Conservation District, Georgetown, Delaware. Dated 2003.
 North Carolina State University Department of Forestry Costs of Forestry Best Management Practices in the South: A Review.
 Recent bid tabulations for wastewater treatment facilities.
The cost estimates are unit cost estimates where there is a lack of detail or specificity about the management practice. For example, for an inter-basin transfer of water, the cost is driven by the length and size of the pipeline and the quantity to be transferred. If the connection locations and or the transfer quantity are not known, a unit cost per mile of pipeline is given. Where there is detail about the management practice, unit cost data were used to develop an approximate capital/programmatic cost. The capital costs were adjusted to 2010 dollars using the Engineering News Record Cost Index. In summary, some cost estimates are unit costs with different unit basis and some costs are approximate capital costs. Therefore, each management practice was assigned a cost (where applicable) rather than rolling up the costs into general categories since they may not be additive. The cost information provided in this document will be used to pursue loans, grants, and other funding options that can be prioritized throughout the region.
Funding Sources and Options
Several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the different management practices outlined in this Plan including:
 The State Revolving Fund Program
 Other State of Georgia Funding Programs
 State and Federal Grants
 Water/Wastewater System Revenues
 State and local government incentive programs
More details on potential loan and grant programs are provided for the management practices in Table 7-2. Below is a list of some of the larger organizations and agencies that provide funding for the types of management practices recommended in this Plan. It is important to note that funding sources and opportunities change on a yearly basis.

7.3. Alignment with Other Plans
The Coastal Council’s Plan and management practices selection process was based on identifying and supporting existing policy, planning, and projects. Local comprehensive plans, planned and/or permitted projects were relied upon in developing the Regional Water Plan. This approach is tailored to maintain consistency with, and to maximize support for, locally driven water resource management decisions. The Coastal Council did identify potential challenges associated with both the cost and technical issues that the region may face; especially regarding water and wastewater needs for both new and aging infrastructure. In addition, addressing existing surface and groundwater gaps must be accomplished in a manner that does not cause adverse impacts to local water users and local governments.
Water resource decisions in the Coastal Georgia Region are affected by regulatory process related to Savannah River water quality and bi-state discussions regarding the Savannah River and salt water intrusion in the Savannah/Hilton Head region. The outcome of these discussions and potential recommendations or other decisions will have important implications for the Regional Water Plan and will need to be incorporated and/or reconciled with the Regional Water Plan as this information becomes available.
The challenges of funding Plan recommendations and addressing future technical and regulatory issues is especially difficult for smaller towns and utilities, agricultural

water uses, and small businesses that rely on natural resources. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will be dependent on the principles of support and leadership by state agencies, in a collaborative setting, utilizing incentives and financial assistance to the extent possible.
7.4. Recommendations to the State
The Coastal Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning.
The Coastal Council is sensitive to unintended consequences if Plan recommendations become mandates. The State must help balance Plan recommendations with assessing measurable progress toward Plan implementation. If additional rules or other administrative or regulatory actions are deemed necessary, the State should work with Councils to help ensure workable solutions.
The following specific recommendations to the State are provided to help aid in the successful implementation of the Plan.
Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD)
 Consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long-term commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Plan recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and help provide funding, permitting and technical support to address gaps and water resource needs.
 Support and facilitate the Savannah River Harbor Total Maximum Daily Load Stakeholder process. Allowing stakeholders from both Georgia and South Carolina to identify possible solutions to pollutant loading will help ensure implementable solutions. EPD’s assistance in coordinating, facilitating, and providing technical support to this process is essential. The Coastal Council supports this process and has indicated that a successful conclusion of this process is identification and implementation of pollutant loading strategies (management practices) which can improve dissolved oxygen conditions in the lower Savannah River.
 Provide leadership, coordination, and technical support to the Upper Floridan Aquifer Salt Water Intrusion Stakeholder Process. This bi-state process between Georgia and South Carolina is charged with developing potential comprehensive management strategies to address salt water intrusion in the Savannah/Hilton Head region. The Coastal Georgia Regional Water Plan

provides recommended management practices based on preliminary assumptions on the amounts of groundwater withdrawals that may be allowed to meet current and future demands. The outcome of this stakeholder process could significantly change some of these assumptions and the Council’s recommended management practices. Consequently, EPD will also need to continue to serve as a “bridge” between the State water planning process and this stakeholder process.
Work with Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Georgia Department of Agriculture, University of Georgia and other relevant institutions to improve agricultural water use data collection and management. This effort would focus on refining source(s) of supply for multiple irrigation sources, continuing to assess data on crop water requirements, evaluating the effects of farm ponds on direct irrigation withdrawals and the hydrologic cycle, and further research on crop consumptive use. This data in turn should be coordinated with Resource Assessment tools to ensure accurate simulation of any gaps and assumptions.
Focus funding support and permitting assistance to projects and programs aimed at addressing gap areas. Where possible, leverage federal funds to help support and expedite project implementation.
Consider collaborative approaches to collecting more standardized water use data and improving data on water demands. This would include continued improvement and updating databases used in the planning process. It would also involve working with the Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia Association of County Commissioners, and other relevant stakeholders to improve water use information.
Working with Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, examine opportunities to improve coordination among water providers and users and create incentives to maximize existing infrastructure and coordinated operations.
Track, support, and participate in South Carolina water planning efforts. Successful planning in the Coastal Region and Savannah-Upper Ogeechee Region will benefit from constructive and collaborative engagement of South Carolina on issues associated with the current and future use of the Savannah River for both water supply and wastewater assimilation. Sustainable use and management of the Savannah River is critical to the social and economic future of both Georgia and South Carolina.
Continue to engage in dialogue and data-sharing with the States of Florida and South Carolina regarding current and forecasted groundwater use. South Georgia, North Florida, and South Carolina rely on the Upper Floridan Aquifer to meet water supply needs and it is in EPD’s best interest to include the

most accurate available information on growth and groundwater use in both states in the Resource Assessment modeling.
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA)
 Meeting forecasted water supply needs will require stable and flexible funding sources to assist water users and water and wastewater utilities in meeting forecasted needs. A stable GEFA financing source(s) should be maintained for necessary water supply, water and wastewater plant construction, and plant upgrades to address current and future gaps.
Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC)
 Continue to support and fund the GFC Forestry Best Management Practices Program. Providing education and incentives to control erosion and sedimentation will help the region prevent/address TMDL listed segments, reduce nutrient loadings, and support wetland areas. This will have the benefit of helping sustain baseflow conditions of streams and water quality.
Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC)
GSWCC should continue to provide leadership and locally focused efforts in the following programs:
 Continue education and outreach associated with Urban Erosion and Sediment Control program including certification of individuals involved in land disturbing activities and on-site implementation of erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plans. This will help address the water quality needs of the region.
 Continue education and outreach efforts to agricultural interests through annual Irrigation Meetings and other avenues to inform farmers of available technologies and funding sources to make more efficient use of water resources without incurring hardship.
 Support completion, maintenance and improvement of the Agricultural Water Use Measurement Program, which is aimed at cost effectively collecting agricultural water use data across the State, and integrating cooperative arrangements with the private sector and partnerships with other State agencies. This program is a vital component to helping the State and regions effectively manage and utilize water resources.
 Support Georgia Agricultural Conservation Incentive program, which provides funding support to help implement conservation practices. Funding for this program is essential to help implement conservation measures, especially in the regional watersheds where there are surface water gaps.
