7. Implementing Water Management  Practices 
7.2. Fiscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices 
The following subsections discuss planning level cost estimates for the water management practices selected by the Suwannee-Satilla Council and potential funding sources and options.  Successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan is highly dependent on the ability of state and local governments, water providers, and utilities to fund the needed implementation actions. 
Planning Level Cost Estimates 
Planning level cost estimates were prepared for each management practice as shown in Table 7-2 using planning guidance documents, the knowledge base of previous state and utility planning efforts, and other sources of information, as listed below: 
. 	Georgia EPD Supplemental Guidance for Planning Contractors: Water 
Management Practice Cost Comparison dated March 2010 (Revised March 
2011). 

. 	Water Conservation Analysis Technical Memorandum to Supplement Council’s Plan prepared by CDM for Georgia EPD draft dated July 2011.  
. 	CDM Water Supply Cost Estimation Study prepared for the South Florida 
Water Management District dated February 2007. 

. 	EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control Practices – Preliminary Report dated February 5, 2006. 
. 	EPA Report titled Costs of Urban Stormwater Control dated January 2002. 
. 	St. Johns River Water Management District Report titled Water Supply Needs and Sources Assessment Alternative Water Supply Strategies Investigation, Water Supply and Wastewater Systems Component Cost Information dated 1997 (Publication Number SJ97-SP3). 
. 	Preliminary estimates of production well yields and costs from local licensed well drillers in Georgia (Bishop Well and Pump Service and Grosch Irrigation Company.)  
. 	Georgia Geologic Survey Project Report 32 titled Irrigation Conservation 
Practices Appropriate for the Southeastern United States. Prepared in 
cooperation with the Georgia DNR, EPD. 

. 	Groundwater Flow Modeling of the Coastal Plain Aquifer System of Georgia.  Draft Report completed for EPD as part of State of Georgia Groundwater Resource Assessment. 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 

. 	FY 2004 Sussex Conservation District Cover Crop Program Fact Sheet. 
Sussex Conservation District, Georgetown, Delaware dated 2003. 

. 	North Carolina State University Department of Forestry presentation titled Costs of Forestry Best Management Practices in the South: A Review dated 2002. 
. 	Recent bid tabulations for wastewater treatment facilities. 
The cost estimates are unit cost estimates where there is a lack of detail or specificity about the management practice. For example, for an inter-basin transfer of water, the cost is driven by the length and size of the pipeline and the quantity to be transferred. If the connection locations and or the transfer quantity are not known, a unit cost per mile of pipeline is given.  Where there is detail about the management practice, unit cost data were used to develop an approximate capital/programmatic cost.  The capital costs were adjusted to 2010 dollars using the Engineering News Record Cost Index. In summary, some cost estimates are unit costs with different unit basis and some costs are approximate capital costs. Therefore, each management practice was assigned a cost (where applicable) rather than rolling up the costs into general categories since they may not be additive.  The cost information provided in this document will be used to pursue loans, grants, and other funding options that can be prioritized throughout the region. 
Funding Sources and Options 
Several different funding sources and options will be used to secure funding for the different management practices outlined in this Plan including: 
. 	The State Revolving Fund Program 
. 	Other State of Georgia Funding Programs 
. 	State and Federal Grants 
. 	Water/Wastewater System Revenues  
. 	State and local government incentive programs 
More details on potential loan and grant programs are provided for the management practices in Table 7-2. Below is a list of some of the larger organizations and agencies that provide funding for the types of management practices recommended in this Plan.  It is important to note that funding sources and opportunities change on a yearly basis. 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Programs 
The EPA provides grants to States, non-profits, and educational institutions to support high-quality research that will improve the scientific basis for decisions on

national environmental issues and help the EPA to achieve its goals.  The EPA provides research grants and graduate fellowships; supports environmental education projects that enhance the public’s awareness, knowledge, and skills to make informed decisions that affect environmental quality;  offers information for State and local governments and small businesses on financing environmental services and projects; and provides other financial assistance through programs such as the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF), the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF), and the Brownfield Program.  More information on the EPA can be accessed at: www.epa.gov. 
The EPA offers the following grant programs: 
. Continuing Program Grants  
. Project Grants 
. Clean Water State Revolving Fund Program 
. Water Pollution Control Program 
. Water Quality Cooperative Agreements Program 
. Water Quality Management Planning Program 
. Onsite Wastewater Management Planning Program 
. Drinking Water State Revolving Fund Loan Program 
Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) 
The mission of EPD is to help provide Georgia's citizens with clean air, clean water, healthy lives and productive land by assuring compliance with environmental laws and by assisting others to do their part for a better environment.  As a result of the Clean Water Act, each year the State of Georgia receives funding from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to assist the State with addressing environmental issues. EPD offers the following grant programs: 
. Section 319 (h) Grants 
. Section 604 (b) Grants 
U.S. Department of Agriculture – Natural Resource Conservation Service (USDA-NRCS) Conservation Programs 
The USDA-NRCS offers a number of funding opportunities as a result of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002. This Act is landmark legislation for conservation funding and for focusing on environmental issues.  The conservation provisions will assist farmers and ranchers in meeting environmental challenges on their land. This legislation simplifies existing programs and creates new programs to address high priority environmental and production goals. The USDA-NRCS offers the following funding options: 

. Conservation of Private Grazing Land Program 
. Conservation Security Program 
. Environmental Quality Incentives Program 
. Farmland Protection Program 
. Resource Conservation and Development Program

7.3. Alignment with Other Plans 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council’s Plan and management practices selection process was based on identifying and supporting existing policy, planning, and projects. Local comprehensive plans, planned and/or permitted projects were relied upon in developing the Regional Water Plan. This approach is tailored to maintain consistency with, and to maximize support for, locally driven water resource management decisions. The Suwannee-Satilla Council did identify potential challenges associated with both the cost and technical issues that the region may face; especially regarding water and wastewater needs for both new and aging infrastructure.  In addition, addressing existing surface water gaps must be accomplished in a manner that does not cause adverse impacts to local water users and local governments. 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


7. Implementing Water Management  Practices 
The challenges of funding Plan recommendations and addressing future technical and regulatory issues is especially difficult for smaller towns and utilities, agricultural water uses, and small businesses that rely on natural resources. The successful implementation of the Regional Water Plan will be dependent on the principles of support and leadership by state agencies, in a collaborative setting, utilizing incentives and financial assistance to the extent possible. 
7.4. Recommendations to the State 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council supports the concept of regional water resource planning with a focus on planning Councils composed of local governments, water users, water providers, industry, business, and affected stakeholders. Local representatives are typically most familiar with local water resource issues and needs. The State has a vital role providing technical support, guidance, and funding to support locally focused water resource planning. This Plan should be viewed as a living, iterative document and the State should focus on the following principles: 
Education, Incentives, Collaboration, Cooperation, Enabling, Supporting 
The Suwannee-Satilla Council is sensitive to unintended consequences if Plan recommendations become mandates or infringe upon private property rights. The State must help balance Plan recommendations with assessing measurable progress toward Plan implementation. If additional rules or other administrative or regulatory actions are deemed necessary, the State should work with Councils to help ensure workable solutions. 
The following specific recommendations to the State are provided to help aid in the successful implementation of the Plan.  
Georgia Environmental Protection Division (EPD) 
. 	Consider “institutionalizing” planning. This would entail a long term commitment of staff and funding to: monitor and support Plan recommendations; coordinate improved data collection, management and analysis; continue to develop and improve Resource Assessment tools; and help provide funding, permitting, and technical support to address gaps and water resource needs. 
. 	Work with Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission, Georgia Department of Agriculture, University of Georgia and other relevant institutions to improve agricultural water use data collection and management. This effort would focus on refining source(s) of supply for multiple irrigation sources, continuing to assess data on crop water requirements, evaluating the effects of farm ponds on direct irrigation withdrawals and the hydrologic cycle, and further research on crop consumptive use. This data in turn should be coordinated with Resource Assessment tools to ensure accurate simulation of any gaps and assumptions. 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
. 	Work with the Southern Georgia Regional Commission to expand water quality monitoring of tributaries on the State’s 303(d) list and tributaries identified as having little or no dissolved oxygen assimilative capacity. Develop a new dissolved oxygen standard that reflects the naturally low concentrations in blackwater streams that are prevalent in this area. 
. 	Focus funding support and permitting assistance to projects and programs aimed at addressing gap areas. Where possible, leverage federal funds to help support and expedite project implementation. 
. 	Consider collaborative approaches to collecting more standardized water use data and improving data on water demands. This would include continued improvement and updating databases used in the planning process. It would also involve working with the Georgia Municipal Association, Georgia Association of County Commissioners, and other relevant stakeholders to improve water use information. 
. 	Working with Georgia Environmental Finance Authority, examine opportunities to improve coordination among water providers and users and create incentives to maximize existing infrastructure and coordinated operations. 
. 	Continue to engage in dialogue and data-sharing with the States of Florida and South Carolina regarding current and forecasted groundwater use. South Georgia, North Florida, and South Carolina rely on the Upper Floridan Aquifer to meet water supply needs and it is in EPD’s best interest to include the most accurate available information on growth and groundwater use in both states in the Resource Assessment modeling. 
Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) 
. 	Meeting forecasted water supply needs will require stable and flexible funding sources to assist water users and water and wastewater utilities in meeting forecasted needs. A stable GEFA financing source(s) should be provided for necessary water supply, water and wastewater plant construction, and plant upgrades to address current and future gaps. 
Georgia Forestry Commission (GFC) 
. 	Continue to support and fund the GFC Forestry Best Management Practices Program. Providing education and incentives to control erosion and segmentation will help the region prevent/address TMDL listed segments, reduce nutrient loadings, and support wetland areas. This will have the benefit of helping sustaining baseflow conditions of streams and water quality. 
SUWANNEE-SATILLA 


Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC) 
GSWCC should continue to provide leadership and locally focused efforts in the following programs: 
. 	Continue education and outreach associated with Urban Erosion and Sediment Control program including certification of individuals involved in land disturbing activities and on-site implementation of erosion, sedimentation, and pollution control plans. This will help address the water quality needs of the region. 
. 	Continue education and outreach efforts to agricultural interests through annual Irrigation Meetings and other avenues to inform farmers of available technologies and funding sources to make more efficient use of water resources without incurring hardship. 
. 	Support completion, maintenance and improvement of the Agricultural Water Use Measurement Program, which is aimed at cost effectively collecting agricultural water use data across the state, and integrating cooperative arrangements with the private sector and partnerships with other State agencies. This program is a vital component to helping the State and regions effectively manage and utilize water resources. 
. 	Support Georgia Agricultural Conservation Incentive program, which provides funding support to help implement conservation practices. Funding for this program is essential to help implement conservation measures, especially in the regional watersheds where there are surface water gaps. 
. 	Provide incentives to restore wetlands and historically drained hardwood swamps and other natural retention areas. Restoration of these features will replenish sources of headwaters by retaining surface runoff and releasing it over a longer period to offset loss of baseflows between rain events, while also providing additional recharge to surficial aquifers. 
Office of State Planning and Budget (OPB) 
. 	Obtain population census data and compare to population forecasts to track trends in the accuracy of population projections. 
. 	Revise population forecasts and support ongoing state-wide planning. 
Department of Community Affairs (DCA) 
. 	Identify and encourage local governments to integrate Regional Water Plan management practices with land use and water quality/quantity nexuses into their comprehensive planning efforts.  
. 	Continue to promote coordinated environmental planning. 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
In-State Universities and Colleges 
. 	Research the percent loss and consumption of irrigation water applied to crops to estimate how much of the water that is applied to a crop is lost to evaporation, runs off into surface waters, and infiltrates to groundwater. 
. 	Research varieties of crops that require less water and are more drought resistant. 
. 	Research the impacts of development and various land uses on aquifer recharge areas. 
. 	Research the effectiveness of management practices to control non-point source pollutants such as sediment, fecal coliform, and nutrients in stormwater runoff from different land uses including urban and rural development, agriculture, and silviculture. 
. 	Research the role played by wetlands in abating runoff flows from storm events, providing source water for surface water features, and treating surface water quality. Evaluate the benefits of restoring previously drained and/or developed wetlands to their natural state. 
Georgia Department of Agriculture (DOA) 
. 	Provide technical information and participate in needed studies to better characterize agricultural water uses and quantification of shortages to low flow conditions. 
. 	Assist with outreach and education of agricultural users to obtain greater understanding of surface water resource limitations, both quality and quantity, and to help improve the implementation rate of management practices. Assist EPD and other state agencies in coordinating accomplishment of the above goals with the Georgia Farm Bureau. 
Georgia Department of Natural Resources [Coastal Resources Division (CRD) and Wildlife Resources Division (WRD)] 
. 	Continue to monitor resources and help sustain, enhance, protect and conserve Georgia’s natural, historic, and cultural resources. 
. 	Provide technical and ecosystem information to help support state water planning needs.
