7.2 iscal Implications of Selected Water Management Practices 
The availability of funding and time are critical determinants in successful implementation of management practices. Sources of funding for programs and studies identified in the selected management practices could come directly from revenues generated by water/wastewater providers, local government general funds raised through property taxes, or service fees charged by local governments to citizens. Alternatively, water providers and individuals can apply for loans and/or grants to finance capital improvement practices or programs. Affected authorities and individuals in the region will be responsible for determining the best method for funding and implementing applicable management practices. Several funding methods are outlined below. 
• 	
Water/Wastewater Rates -Water rates should be based on a local rate study and be sufficient to support program costs and facility maintenance. 

• 	
General Appropriations (General Fund) - Includes revenues from local taxes 

•	
 Loans/Bonds -Includes immediate borrowing of funds over a 15 to 20 year period with interest charges; typically used for capital improvement pro ects 

• 	
General Obligation Bonds - Based upon local government taxing powers 

• 	
Revenue Bonds - Based upon revenues generated by s specific entity for service fees and water/wastewater rates 

• 	
Georgia Environmental Facilities Authority Loans (GEFA) - Low interest state loans for environmental pro ects; the Clean Water State Revolving Loan Fund is administered by GEFA 

• 	
WaterFirst - Administered by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs; communities who apply for and become designated as Water First communities receive discounts on GEFA loan interest rates 



• 	
Service Fees -Special taxes established by local governments for specific programs 

• 	
Grants -State or federal financial aid which may fully or partially fund pro ects; typically awarded on a competitive basis 

• 	
Section 19(h) - Under the federal Clean Water Act, Section 19(h) provides federal funding 

•

7.4 Recommendations to the State 
The Middle Chattahoochee Water Planning Council has identified the following recommendations to the State. The Council intends these actions to begin following acceptance and issuance of the Regional Water Plan. These actions are for immediate action, action between now and the next update to the plan and for consideration in future updates to this plan. They are as follows 
. omprehensive Overhaul of the Water ontrol Manual and Operating Procedures 
The Council advocates that EPD review and further consider the model constraints and results performed by Dr. Georgakakos of the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech. The proposed changes in operating parameters for the federal reservoirs in the Chattahoochee River show significant improvement over the current RIOP and appear to provide a much better balance between water withdrawals, instream uses and the Congressional authorized purposes of the federal reservoirs. 
The Council recognizes that specific operating targets should come from more detailed modeling and analysis but in general, expect the outcomes to include more available storage in the reservoirs, more rapid refill after drought periods, higher lake levels especially on West Point Lake, and flow guidelines at the Columbus and Columbia planning nodes. The following modeling constraints (reference Table 5-1 from Section 5) are the beginning point for revisions to the Corps' water control manual. 
Furthermore, the Council requests that on its behalf that EPD convene a meeting with the U.S. Army Corps during the vetting process of the new water control manual and ask them to review the work of this Council and the preliminary modeling work done by the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech regarding adaptive reservoir management in the ACF basin. 
2. ask .orces for labama and nergy Water Use .orecasting 
Future Alabama water use needs were not provided for use in the development of this plan. In collaboration with the State of Alabama, withdrawal and return forecasts for Alabama water users of Chattahoochee River water through the forty year planning horizon should be developed. Utilizing current Alabama demands in the future condition analyses represents a lack of conservatism in the modeling work and is inconsistent with use of forecasted demands for Georgia water users. 
The EPD developed energy water use forecasting, however, this forecasting did not identify geographically specific water needs. Energy water use forecasting must be done to account for greater cooling tower efficiencies, 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

additional energy conservation measures, increased power production in the future, water quality, and other factors as appropriate. 
The Council recommends that EPD designate task forces to develop improved water use forecasts that could be used in future updates of this plan. 
.. Metro orth istrict Returns and utrient . Sediment oading 
The May 7, 2009 Metro North District Plan includes ambitious predictions of returns to the river for which the Middle Chattahoochee resource assessments now greatly depend. The Council would like a comprehensive audit of these predictions and ongoing measurement and regular reporting on the progress to achieving these goals. Furthermore, the Council desires that such progress be reported as a range of statistical flows, including mean, minimum, and maximum values of consumptive use. 
The Middle Chattahoochee Council is also concerned about the nutrient load increase prolected for 2050 that is estimated at the Whitesburg gauge. Nutrient loadings of phosphorus and nitrogen are expected to increase 200 percent by 2050. The Middle Chattahoochee region should not be burdened with additional waste water treatment or storm water BMPs caused by increases in upstream discharges. In addition, the Council is also concerned about sediment loading from upstream land management practices. 
Specific to nutrients, the Council is concerned about the increases in phosphorus and nitrogen and the resulting chlorophyll-a in West Point Lake and Lake Walter F. George and the potential for degradation of lake water quality. 
The Council requests that the Metro North District provide 1) specific details of how the increased nutrient and sediment loads will be mitigated before it reaches the Middle Chattahoochee basin, and 2) provide annual progress reports of nutrient and sediment levels and reduction effectiveness. 
Finally, the Council recommends a peer review of the lake and watershed models to better understand the methodology as it relates to the output and calibration. Pending the review, the council recommends that the model outputs not be utilized for setting water quality standards instream or for any other regulatory purposes, including point source permitting in the region. 
4. Science .ased etermination of .W Minimum Release 
Encourage State and Federal Agencies to reevaluate the scientific justification for required minimum flows below Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam in the Apalachicola River. It is the opinion of this Council that the 5,000 cubic feet per second instantaneous flow target in the 1989 Water Control Manual 
00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww 

September 2011 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 

00.U u:<.. <:00u:ww 

(current operating plan when this plan was published) does not have sound scientific justification. Furthermore, the Council recommends the analysis of alternative structural hydraulic measures such as temporary weirs, gates, and/or steps to control river stage and sediment transport and scour at or below Woodruff Dam in order to protect critical habitat. 
.. urther Research on .round.ater evelopment 
During the 2006-2007 drought, small surface water withdrawals and wells became more common to provide irrigation water to avoid irrigation restrictions. Because of the abundance of groundwater below the Fall Line, the cumulative impact of small groundwater withdrawals has the potential to significantly offset direct river withdrawals and thereby improve base flows. The Council asks EPD to encourage well development in those watersheds not directly impacted by surface water to groundwater interactions. The development should focus on wells in aquifers that may currently be under utilized to augment municipal, industrial and agricultural supplies as an alternative to continued dependence on ma or water courses such as the Chattahoochee River. 
In those areas of the Flint River where surface water to groundwater interactions are known to exist, the Council asks that EPD define the reduction in streamflow associated with increased agricultural groundwater withdrawals to aid in increased interregional coordination between the councils in the ACF Basin. A clear understanding of this effect will reveal the degree to which storage in the Chattahoochee River is relied upon to meet downstream flow requirements below Woodruff Dam. To achieve better agricultural water use data (both groundwater and surface water) the Council recommends improved implementation of the agricultural water withdrawal metering program of the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission by 
•	
 Completing comprehensive installation of meters 

•	
 Ensuring the meters are functioning properly through regular maintenance inspection 

• 	
Increasing data collection on parameters including monthly use, crops, inputs 

• 	
Reporting aggregate results annually to permittees and policymakers 

• 	
Preparing collected data in a manner that will facilitate use in future resource assessments 


.. 	Increase Storage in the System 
This Plan discusses the need to increase storage in the ACF system for both water withdrawal and instream uses and in the Tallapoosa Basin to mitigate modeled surface water availability gaps. Several means to increase storage are discussed, including better utilization of available storage, building more

storage, and seeking to identify new methods of storage such as aquifer storage and recovery for areas with apparent gaps such as the Flint River Basin. 
The Council recommends that EPD develop these conceptual ideas further and provide a more comprehensive plan for increasing storage in the region. The concept of designating environmental storage in the existing federal reservoirs should be explored for the purpose of improving the reliability of meeting consumptive use and downstream flow targets during drought conditions. The Council encourages the study and development of new storage in the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint and Tallapoosa basins to close gaps (Bainbridge, Heflin, and Newell nodes), improve reliability of drought contingency plans, and alleviate the burden of operational requirements on the federal reservoirs in the Middle Chattahoochee region which have become the .work horses. of the ACF system. 
7. Water onservation Program valuation 
The water conservation program is a critical element of this Plan. Currently there are several practical limitations to measuring progress such as inconsistent terminology, lack of available data and the need to identify practical ways of collecting data. Periodically, it will be important to assess the progress and benefit of the water conservation program. Recommendations throughout this plan are intended to address the existing limitations to the degree practicable to develop a sound method of measuring regional progress. 
.. unding for dditional Resource assessments 
The Council recommends that the Legislature provide funding for ongoing additional data collection and the continued refinement of water resource assessments used in the development of the Plan. 
For water quantity, the Council recommends that the state consider further study of the modeling constraints associated with the adaptive reservoir management model for the ACF Basin developed by the Georgia Water Resources Institute at Georgia Tech. This action is recommended within the near-term leading up to the scheduled release of the draft Water Control Manual by the Corps of Engineers July 2011. Additionally, the Council recommends additional modeling scenarios which take into account extreme hydrologic conditions which have occurred outside of the modeled hydro­period currently established (19 8-2007) in the surface water availability models developed by EPD. This could include modeling extreme drought conditions documented from the 1920's and the extreme flood event which occurred in 2009.

The Council also recommends an increased awareness of water balance in the region and therefore, requests that additional measurement and water return ratio studies be performed to better understand consumptive uses and related water returns. Once completed, this information will better equip the Council and region for managing consumptive uses and allow the Council's vision of an abundant water supply for our descendants to be achieved. 
The lack of baseline data for water quality as compared to the level of best management practice (BMP) implementation already in place, as well as a measure of the effectiveness of those practices, makes it difficult to assign management practices to address modeled water quality gaps. Additional funding for water quality assessments and best management practices (BMP) surveys could be complemented through the development of programs similar to those in already in place through the Georgia Forestry Commission or coordination of existing water quality sampling data already being collected to fulfill permit requirements. 
The Georgia Forestry Commission's BMP complaint and survey program could be considered as a model between agricultural users and the National Resource and Conservation Service (NRCS) and Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission (GSWCC). Such efforts would provide documentation necessary to substantiate the concerns of the agricultural community regarding nutrient, bacteria, and dissolved oxygen levels in streams. This program could also assist in a baseline set of observed water quality data versus applied BMPs throughout the region. 
Each municipality with a treated wastewater discharge is required to perform a watershed assessment and implementation plan. Each of the plans includes water quality monitoring. Municipalities could work together with EPD to develop monitoring networks that would complement the monitoring efforts of the EPD and others if funding were made available. 
.. Increase State unding for Implementation of Management Practices 
The Council recommends that EPD explore all possible funding sources to offset or pay for many of the management practices outlined in the Plan. Financial incentives and reimbursement for implementation of practices will expedite the progress needed to achieve the goals of the Plan. 
.. reation of Water Planning istricts and Interstate ompacts 
The Council recognizes the historical lack of sufficient study and funding for water planning in the State. The Council therefore recommends that the Legislature study and codify into state law, a plan whereby the planning, management and oversight of water and watershed resources in the state be delegated to stakeholder led water or watershed councils. The new water councils would have funding and staff for ongoing research, studies,

assessments, measurement, monitoring and reporting on the progress of goals and future updates to the Plan. In the case of the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint Basin councils, the Council urges the state to also consider how these councils would function under an interstate compact. 
The Council recognizes and encourages the potential of an interstate compact for the ACF Basin. The Council also recognizes the examples of the Great Lakes Basin Compact, several of the Texas river basin compacts (i.e. Sabine River Compact Commission) and other successful stakeholder led water councils managing large river basins that cross geopolitical boundaries such as the Fraser River Basin Council, British Columbia, Canada. The creation of collective legislative action with member states with shared water resources should be developed to guide Florida, Georgia and Alabama on environmental, economic and operational issues relating to water resources management of the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin. 
. oordinated Recommendations .ith eighboring councils 
Throughout the process of developing this plan, the Middle Chattahoochee Water Council met several times with neighboring regional water councils to discuss shared water resources and topics of concern. The Council met several times with the Upper Flint and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Water Councils and developed a collaborative relationship with these councils that led to their agreement on a set of oint recommendations. 
The following oint recommendations were approved by all three councils Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Middle Chattahoochee. The agreement among these councils on these recommendations indicates the importance of these recommendations to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint System, of which all three councils are a part, and to the state as a whole. 
These oint recommendations overlap with some of the Middle Chattahoochee Water Council's own management practices and recommendations. Where overlap does occur, the Council does not see any conflict; usually, the Council's management practices and recommendations provide more detail than the oint recommendation. In all cases, the Council's own regional water plan takes precedence over the oint recommendations. 
The Middle Chattahoochee, Upper Flint, and Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Councils 
• 	
Recognize the critical need for more storage in the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) System and recommend that a plan for additional storage be developed and implemented and that it consider the following better utilization of existing storage in the Chattahoochee, new storage in the Flint, and enhancement of existing storage capacity. 

• 	
Urge EPD and those involved in the resource assessment modeling to improve upon existing models for future regional water planning by making greater use of actual and current data on water use and

conditions and by developing assumptions that more closely approximate actual conditions. 
• 	Request that state and federal agencies reevaluate the scientific justification for the minimum flow requirements at Woodruff Dam that are intended to maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems. 
2. Regional Water Plan Use 
The State Water Plan specifies that regional water plans are to guide decisions regarding permitting.  The Middle Chattahoochee Council understands that its plan provides a valuable regional perspective and that this regional water plan will be an important new source of information for EPD and stakeholders.   Except where noted elsewhere, such as Council concerns regarding use of the water quality models, relevant provisions will inform EPD review and evaluation of factors that have to be balanced during permit review. 
However, the Council urges that EPD's permit decisions will continue to be based on the full existing framework of laws, rules, and guidance. Permit decisions should continue to rest upon consideration of the body of detailed information provided by an applicant, and adoption of this regional water plan will not substantially alter permitting processes. The Council expects that communications with permit applicants will be informed by the applicant.s familiarity with the contents of this adopted regional water plan and the ways in which the proposed activity addresses plan provisions. .
