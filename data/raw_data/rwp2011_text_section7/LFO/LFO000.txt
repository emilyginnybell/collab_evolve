7.3 Alignment with Other Plans 
The development of this plan by the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council builds upon a knowledge base developed in previous planning efforts by state and local governments and authorities.  Numerous existing water resources related plans and information sources were consulted in the development of this plan. More information on these documents can be found in Supplemental Document 6 - Existing Regulatory and Local Plan Review and Supplemental Document 14 - Management Practice Selection Technical Memorandum, available on the Lower Flint- Ochlockonee Council’s website (http://www.flintochlockonee.org/pages/our_plan/index.php). 
The council also ensured alignment with other Regional Water Plans by participating in a series of joint meetings, especially with the Upper Flint and Middle Chattahoochee Councils. In these meetings, council members discussed shared issues relating to resource availability, quality, policy, regulatory, and funding issues. As a result of this collaboration, where possible, the councils coordinated their plans. No conflicts between these regional plans have been identified. 
Alignment with the existing Flint River Basin Regional Water Development and Conservation Plan (2006) was discussed by the Council throughout the planning 
7-13 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE 

process. While the Council’s recommendations improve upon the 2006 plan, none of its recommendations conflict with that plan.1 

7.4 Recommendations to the State 
The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council has identified several recommended actions that would improve water resource management and planning in this region and the state as a whole. 


Information Needs 
Addressing the following information needs would support improved water resources management and future water planning. Implementation of research and assessments to fill these information needs will require funding (state, federal, other). Implementing agencies are not indicated here; if funding is identified, qualified researchers from state universities, institutions, and agencies, as well as private sector firms, can fulfill these information needs. As new information is developed, it should be incorporated into future cycles of the regional water planning process and used in the resource assessments that are a part of the regional water planning process. 
. 	Evaluate the environmental and other impacts of low flow conditions modeled at the Bainbridge planning node; determine a low flow criteria below which adverse ecosystem impacts are predicted. 
. 	Improve implementation of the agricultural water withdrawal metering program of the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission by: 
o 	Completing comprehensive installation of meters 

o 	Ensuring the meters are functioning properly through regular maintenance inspection 

o 	Increasing data collection on parameters including monthly use, crops, inputs 

o 	Reporting aggregate results annually to permittees and policymakers 

o 	Preparing collected data in a manner that will facilitate use in future resource assessments 


. 	Assess baseline implementation of water conservation and water quality BMPs by agricultural producers. The lack of information on current levels of implementation limits the ability to conduct effective regional water planning. Without an understanding of the baseline level of implementation, the benefits of future conservation activities cannot be accurately estimated.  
1 The 2006 Flint River Basin Regional Water Development and Conservation Plan is described in Section 2.3 and a copy of the 2006 plan is available as Supplemental Document 7 on the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council’s website: http://www.flintochlockonee.org/pages/our_plan/index.php 
September 2011 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
. 	Evaluate implementation and effectiveness of water conservation practices. Water conservation is a priority focus of the management practices in this plan, but there are currently several practical limitations to measuring progress and impact in conservation implementation, such as inconsistent terminology, lack of available data and the need to identify practical ways of collecting data. Periodically, it will be important to assess the progress and benefit of the water conservation program. 
. 	Encourage State and Federal Agencies to reevaluate the scientific justification for the minimum flow requirements for maintaining healthy aquatic ecosystems below Jim Woodruff Lock and Dam in the Apalachicola River. It is the opinion of this Council that the 5,000 cubic feet per second instantaneous flow target in the 1989 Water Control Manual (current operating plan when this plan was published) does not have sound scientific justification. 
. 	Evaluate the impacts of farm ponds on stream flows through intercepted drainage and evaporative loss. Also improve how farm pond withdrawals are incorporated into the resource assessment models. 
. 	Update water quality model assumptions in future resource assessments to reflect actual volumes treated by various wastewater treatment methods (e.g., land application, discharging facility). The assumption that current allocations among these methods will remain the same may not be accurate given in-stream flow concerns. 

Water Policy Recommendations 
The following recommendations urge the Georgia General Assembly and other policymakers (e.g., Georgia Board of Natural Resources) to pursue actions to improve water resource management in the state and in the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Region. 
. 	The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly provide funding for continued planning by the regional water councils in order to ensure continued progress toward the vision and goals of the state and regional water plans. The Council also recommends that the General Assembly provide funding to support monitoring of plan implementation, data collection to support future planning by the regional water councils, and continued refinement of water resource assessments used in the development of the regional water plans. 
. 	The Council recommends that the Georgia General Assembly and implementing agencies, such as EPD, explore all possible funding sources to offset or pay for many of the management practices outlined in this Plan. Financial incentives and reimbursement for implementation of practices will expedite the progress needed to achieve the goals of this Plan. 
7-15 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
LOWER FLINT-OCHLOCKONEE 

. 	The Council urges the Georgia General Assembly and other state policymakers not to preclude interbasin transfer as an option for future water management in the region, as needed and following thorough scientific evaluation. Interbasin transfer (IBT) of water can provide supply or flows to a receiving basin where water is needed. IBTs are used in many places in Georgia at this time. However, the Council recommends against any new interbasin transfers from any basin for which this planning process identified concerns about maintaining a sustainable in­stream flow regime. 
. 	The Council recommends that no modifications to existing water withdrawal permitting practices be enacted based on the surface water availability and groundwater availability resource assessment model results. For a more complete discussion of the Council’s concerns with the modeling approaches and results, please see Section 5.4. 
. 	The Council recommends that irrigation suspension be used only through implementation of the Flint River Drought Protection Act (OCGA §12-5­40) and only by voluntary means, which will require adequate funding to support implementation of the Act. In some years, irrigation suspension may be needed in order to sustain in-stream flows in particularly dry periods. The Council supports voluntary implementation of the Flint River Drought Protection Act through an irrigation suspension auction, when absolutely necessary in dry periods. However, adequate funding is not currently available for implementation of the Act and will be needed if implementation becomes necessary. Additionally, the Council recommends notification to farmers of irrigation suspension earlier than the March 1 drought declaration deadline. The Council acknowledges the need to improve drought prediction tools to support earlier notification and supports EPD efforts to develop better predictive tools. 
. 	The Council recommends that the General Assembly provide funding and authority (or other mechanism) for the Council to work with the USFWS to resolve potential conflicts between agricultural water use and imperiled species in the region. The Council urges all appropriate state agencies to join in this process, including the EPD. The Council supports consideration of a Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) as a tool that should be evaluated to provide for both habitat protection and irrigation supply needs in the region, while also reducing the liability and uncertainty associated with potential Endangered Species Act enforcement or litigation. 
. 	The Council recommends that the General Assembly legislate authority to the Regional Water Councils, including the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council, to manage, plan and provide oversight of water resources within each region around the State. Funding should be provided to the Councils from State appropriations and from the granting of revenue-raising authority to each Regional Council. Revenue should not be raised 
September 2011 

7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
through property taxation Funding should provide for coordination and the implementation of the regional and state water plans and for studies, assessments, and future plan updates. 
. 	The Council urges the State to seek a timely resolution of current interstate water issues that directly affect the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint Basin. The Council recommends the development of a tri-state framework designed to address interstate water issues in the future and the inclusion of the Regional Water Councils within this framework. 
. 	The Council recommends continued coordination and cooperation among neighboring water councils. The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council has worked closely with the Middle Chattahoochee and Upper Flint Councils, and our joint efforts will benefit our regions and the state as a whole. 

Coordinated Recommendations with Neighboring Councils 
Throughout the process of developing this plan, the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council met several times with neighboring regional water councils to discuss shared water resources and topics of concern. The Council met several times with the Upper Flint and Middle Chattahoochee Councils and developed a collaborative relationship with these councils that led to their agreement on a set of joint recommendations. 
The following joint recommendations were approved by all three councils: Upper Flint, Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, and Middle Chattahoochee. The agreement among these councils on these recommendations indicates the importance of these recommendations to the Apalachicola-Chattahoochee-Flint Basin, of which all three councils are a part, and to the state as a whole. 
These joint recommendations overlap with some of the Lower Flint-Ochlockonee Council’s own management practices and recommendations. Where overlap does occur, the Council does not see any conflict; the Council’s management practices and recommendations generally provide more detail than the joint recommendations. In all cases, the Council’s own regional water plan takes precedence over the joint recommendations.  
The Lower Flint-Ochlockonee, Upper Flint, and Middle Chattahoochee Councils:  
. 	Recognize the critical need for more storage in the Apalachicola­Chattahoochee-Flint (ACF) System and recommend that a plan for additional storage be developed and implemented and that it consider the following: better utilization of existing storage in the Chattahoochee, new storage in the Flint, and enhancement of existing storage capacity. 
. 	Urge EPD and those involved in the resource assessment modeling to improve upon existing models for future regional water planning by making greater use of actual and current data on water use and conditions and by developing assumptions that more closely approximate actual conditions.  
7-17 

. 	Request that state and federal agencies reevaluate the scientific justification for the minimum flow requirements at Woodruff Dam that are intended to maintain healthy aquatic ecosystems.
