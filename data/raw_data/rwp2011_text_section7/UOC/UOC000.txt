Implementing Water Management Practices 
This Section presents the Council’s roadmap for implementing the water MPs identified in Section 6. As the State Water Plan indicates, this Regional Water Plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the Region along with the other responsible parties described below. 
Once adopted, this Regional Water Plan will be used to guide permitting decisions by GAEPD and guide the awarding of State grants and loans from the Georgia Environmental Finance Authority (GEFA) for water-related projects. And this plan can help inform and guide other GAEPD programs such as the awarding of Section 319(h) Nonpoint Source Implementation Grant funds. 
7.1 Implementation Schedule and 

Roles of Responsible Parties 
Tables 7-1(a) to 7-1(d) identify the initial, short- and long-term actions needed to implement the MPs detailed in Tables 6-1(a) to 6-1(d) and the corresponding responsible parties for each series of actions. Actions for implementation are framed as either initial activities expected to occur in the first year, 2012, or as short- and long-term actions. The Council has defined short-term as occurring between 2013 and 2016 and long-term as the year 2017 and beyond. It is assumed that all long-term activities would occur after the 5-year Regional Water Plan update, allowing for the Council to revisit these actions using an adaptive management approach. 
While the bulk of implementation actions noted in Tables 7-1(a) to 7-1(d) fall to local governments and utilities and their respective RCs, extensive support for initial activities, in particular, will be needed from State entities, such as GAEPD, DCA, Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH), Division of Public Health, Environmental Health Section, and GEFA. This Regional Water Plan also assumes continued support from the Council in some capacity beyond its current 3-year appointment. Support from other organizations, such as the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG), Georgia Green Industry Association (GGIA), Georgia Municipal Association (GMA), Georgia Rural Water Association (GRWA), and Georgia Association of Water Professionals (GAWP), will also be needed to implement the MPs in an efficient, cost­effective manner.

Implementation of Water Conservation Management Practices 
Table 7-1(a) lists implementation details for the 12 Water Conservation MPs selected by the Council and detailed in Table 6­1(a). The list includes a wide variety of practices, such as practices that benefit all communities (e.g., WC-4, Implement education and public awareness program) and practices that may be appropriate for some communities, but not for others (e.g., WC-7, Encourage non-potable reuse). Each community will need to evaluate all the practices to determine which are appropriate for it to implement. Communities with Resource Assessment gaps or infrastructure needs/shortages are strongly encouraged to implement these Water Conservation practices to address these water resource issues. All communities will need to track and report on their implementation activities as described in Section 8 to help monitor progress in meeting the benchmarks.

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans 
As discussed in Section 6, a review of regional and local plans served as the basis for the development of the Region’s selected MPs; a summary of the local and regional plans reviewed is provided in the supplemental document titled Review and Summary of Existing Plans, which is available on the Council websiteF 8. As a result, this Regional Water Plan is generally aligned and consistent with these efforts; however, the following sections describe ongoing efforts and/or differences that are worth noting and revisiting during future Regional Water Plan updates. 
7.3.1 .
Metro Water District Plans 
The Metro Water District was created by the Georgia General Assembly in 2001 to establish policy, create plans, and promote intergovernmental coordination within the 15-county metro Atlanta region, which includes more than 90 cities. The Metro Water District is therefore governed by a separate authorizing legislation than the Region, though the two are similar in some respects. For example, the Metro Water District is funded by State appropriations and per capita local government dues; it is governed by an elected/appointed Governing Board, which sets policy and direction. Metro Water District staffing is provided by the Atlanta Regional Commission Environmental Planning Division, while plans and policies are guided by the Board Executive and Finance Committees, the Technical Coordinating Committee, and the Basin Advisory Councils (Metro Water District, 2011). 
Local governments and utilities are responsible for implementing the Regional Water Plans at the local level, and compliance with the plans is directly enforced through the GAEPD’s permitting process. However, while this Regional Water Plan will guide GAEPD’s future permitting decisions, local governments must be in compliance with the Metro Water District’s plans to obtain a permit for an increased water withdrawal or a new or increased discharge, or to obtain an MS4 permit. GAEPD is responsible for auditing local governments to determine compliance with the plans, including audit checklists and site visits. 
In May 2009, the Metro Water District adopted comprehensive updates to the plans the District first adopted in 2003; these long-term water management plans address water supply and water conservation, wastewater management, and watershed management. The Metro Water District plans were referenced extensively during development of the Upper Oconee Council’s MPs; however, substantial differences remain between the District plans and this Regional Water Plan due to data availability and resolution, resources, and legislative mandate.

7.4 Recommendations to the State 
This subsection describes the Council’s recommendations to the State of Georgia for actions that will support the implementation of this Regional Water Plan. Table 7-3 summarizes these recommendations by type and reflects the role the Council envisions the State taking in support of the activities described in Section 7.1.  
Table 7-3: Recommendations to the State  (Continued)  
Recommendation  
Funding  Identify long-term funding mechanism, beyond grants, to assist responsible parties with implementation.  
Work with existing organizations such as the GSWCC to identify incentives to encourage the installation and use of variable rate irrigation systems by a certified irrigation professional.  

Coordination  Coordinate with DCA and the RCs to serve as the clearing house and coordinator for ongoing Regional Water Plan planning activities.  
To provide continuity between Regional Water Plan updates, a minimum of six to nine members of the original Council should be re-appointed.  
The Council should meet bi-annually to track implementation and address potential issues or questions regarding implementation or plan amendments.  
Work with existing organizations, such as ACCG, GMA and GAWP to develop templates and materials that each Regional Council, with the assistance of DCA or the RCs noted in Section 2.3, can adapt for regional / local implementation.  Topic areas from Table 7-1 could include: public education program, water conservation goals regional residential and commercial water audit program materials, golf course water management, grease management, CMOM, general stormwater management and stream buffer protection.  
Work with existing organizations such as the GSWCC and the State’s University System to develop regional watering, nutrient management, cropland management guidelines for the major crops grown in the Region.  
Coordinate with State and local Public Health Departments to: . Develop consistent, minimum design standards that anticipate future centralized sewer connections where appropriate. . Develop example policies for connections to public sewer. . Develop regional recommendations and a model ordinance for decentralized sewer systems.  
Coordinate with GEMA on development of a model flood damage prevention ordinance.

Recommendation  
Policy / Programmatic  Develop and implement a consistent program to meter and report agricultural water withdrawals greater than 100,000 gallons per day.  
Consider modifying (limiting) the extent of exemptions found in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 regarding the Erosion and Sedimentation Control Act.   
Revisit DO criteria for South Georgia, and the Region in particular, to consider naturally low background levels found in the Region.   
Develop regulatory framework and guidelines for water quality credit trading in Georgia.  
Build on existing GAEPD monitoring program to develop a regional long­term ambient trend monitoring network for the Region.   

Next 5-Year Update  Refine Resource Assessment models to allow presentation of results at a finer resolution.  
Conduct further study on the Cretaceous aquifer in Washington, Wilkinson, and Laurens Counties to clarify sustainable yields.  
Collect and monitor withdrawal and discharge data from the kaolin industry to refine the water balance and wastewater return ratio assumptions.  
Support the evaluation of the current in-stream flow policy to determine whether revisions are needed to protect aquatic resources.
