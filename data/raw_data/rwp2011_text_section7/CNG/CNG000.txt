7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
Section 7. Implementing Water Management Practices 
This Section presents the CNG Council’s roadmap for implementing the water management practices identified in Section 6. As the State Water Plan provides, this Regional Water Plan will be primarily implemented by the various water users in the CNG Region along with the other responsible parties described below. 
Once adopted, this Regional Water Plan will be used to: 
Guide permitting decisions by GAEPD. 
utilities  and  their  
corresponding  Regional  
Commissions;  however,  

Guide the awarding of Section 319(h) Nonpoint Source Implementation Grant funds from GAEPD. 
Guide the awarding of State grants and loans for water-related projects. 
7.1 Implementation Schedule and Roles of Responsible Parties 
Tables 7-1(a) through 7-1(d) identify the short-and long-term actions needed to implement the management practices detailed in Tables 6-1(a) through 6-1(d) and the corresponding responsible parties for each series of actions. The Council has defined short-term as occurring between 2013 and 2016 and long-term as year 2017 and beyond. It is assumed that all long-term activities would occur after the 5-year Regional Water Plan update, allowing the Council to revisit these actions using an adaptive management approach. Based on Council feedback the RCs will take the lead role in coordinating and assisting local governments and utilities in implementing the management practices. 
While the bulk of implementation actions noted in this Section fall to local governments and utilities and their corresponding RCs, extensive support for short­term activities, in particular, will be needed from State entities such as GAEPD, DCA, Georgia Department of Community Health (DCH), Division of Public Health, Environmental Health Section, and GEFA. This Regional Water Plan also assumes continued support from the Council in some capacity beyond its current 3-year appointment. Support from other organizations, such as the Association of County Commissioners of Georgia (ACCG), Georgia Green Industry (GGIA), Georgia 
Section Summary 
The Council has developed a roadmap for implementing the Management Practices identified in Section 6. 
It identifies the short-term (2013-2016) and long-term (beyond 2017) actions and the applicable corresponding responsible parties. The responsibility for most of the implementation actions falls to local governments and 
extensive support for short­term activities, in particular, will be needed from various State entities.

Municipal Association (GMA), Georgia Rural Water Association (GRWA), and Georgia Association of Water Professionals (GAWP) will also be needed to implement the management practices in an efficient, cost-effective manner. 
Tables 7-1(a) through 7-1(d) indicate the permit category of the responsible parties for each management practice including the following mechanisms for tracking implementation; the agency responsible for enforcement is in parenthesis: 
Municipal, Golf Course and Agricultural Water Withdrawal (GAEPD) 
Municipal Wastewater Discharge (GAEPD) 
Municipal and Construction Stormwater (GAEPD) 
Safe Dams Program (GAEPD) 
7.1.1 Implementation of Water Conservation Management Practices 
Table 7-1(a) lists implementation details for the 14 Water Conservation Management Practices selected by the Council. The list includes a wide variety of practices, such as: (1) practices that are required by state law (WC-3, Stewardship Act practices), (2) practices that are beneficial for all communities (WC-1, Implement education and public awareness programs) and (3) practices that may be appropriate for some communities but not others (WC-5, Encourage non-potable reuse). Each community will need to evaluate the practices to determine which are appropriate for implementation in their community and are encouraged to adopt all management practices or other equally effective measures. Communities with Resource Assessment gaps or infrastructure needs or shortages are strongly encouraged to implement these management practices to address their gaps, needs, or shortages. All communities will need to report on their implementation activities to the Council and to the GAEPD to help determine the effectiveness of the Regional Water Plan. Finally, it is important to seek out opportunities for implementation across state lines with partners to address impairments and improvements to inter-state waters. 
The industrial sector continually strides to implement water conservation practices that increase productivity while decreasing water use. Particularly in the CNG region, the carpet industry has significantly reduced water usage per unit of carpet manufactured due to industry process improvements, increased efficiencies, and conservation efforts (GTMA, 2009).

7.3 Alignment with Other Plans 
As discussed in Section 6, a review of regional and local plans served as the basis for the development of the Region’s selected management practices; a summary of the local and regional plans reviewed is provided as a supplemental document on the CNG website.11 As a result, this Regional Water Plan is generally aligned and consistent with these efforts; however, the following sections describe ongoing efforts and/or differences that are worth noting and revisiting during future Regional Water Plan updates. 
Alabama-Coosa-Tallapoosa (ACT) Basin Master Water Control Manual 
The ACT Basin Master Water Control Manual is composed of a series of documents, a Master Water Control Manual and 9 individual reservoir manuals. The USACE is in the process of updating these documents for the first time in decades, and the revised Water Control Manual will capture the following (USACE, 2011b): 
Project/system operations refined over the years because of changes in basin hydrology and withdrawals/consumption that resulted from years of growth/development 
Drought contingency requirements to account for new data and operational changes 
Updated data reflecting current basin conditions 
New/rehabilitated project structural features 
Environmental requirements for endangered species and fish spawns 
Procedures for capturing/using real-time data provided by additional gages and monitoring devices installed since last manual updates 
Latest computer models and techniques to evaluate and establish guidelines for project operations 
Improved and streamlined methods for data exchange between the USACE and other agencies. 
The USACE completed the Scoping Report in March 2010 and is in the process of updating the Master Water Control Manual. The hydrologic modeling used for the manual updates differed from the Resource Assessment water quantity model used for the current Regional Water Plan primarily in the way the USACE reservoirs (Carters and Allatoona) in the CNG Region would be operated in the future. These differences, and future policy decisions on the allocation of storage in the reservoirs, may affect the future availability of water for water supply purposes. The final ACT

7-38 

Basin Master Water Control Manual will be integrated into the 5-year CNG Regional Water Plan update. 
Etowah Aquatic Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP) 
In response to the number of imperiled aquatic species found in the Etowah watershed, the USFWS initiated development of the Etowah Aquatic Habitat Conservation Plan (HCP)12. The draft Etowah Aquatic HCP is currently working its way through the USFWS review process. Once that is complete, each local government that submitted an application for an Incidental Take Permit (ITP) will determine whether it wants to move forward with acceptance of the ITP, which includes formal adoption of the HCP. All the provisions of the final HCP, including the policies and ordinances contained therein, must be adopted in order for the local government to receive the ITP. 
Due to the substantial volume of public comments received by USFWS on the draft HCP and uncertainty regarding how those comments will be resolved, the Council considered the HCP policies during the development of its management practices but did not directly integrate them into this Regional Water Plan. The policies incorporated into the final, adopted Etowah Aquatic HCP can be revisited during the 5-year Regional Water Plan update. 
Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District Plans 
The Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (Metro Water District) was created by the Georgia General Assembly in 2001 to establish policy, create plans, and promote intergovernmental coordination within the 15-county metro Atlanta region, which includes more than 90 cities. The Metro Water District is therefore governed by a separate authorizing legislation than the CNG Water Planning Region, though the two are similar in some respects. For example, the Metro Water District is funded by State appropriations and per capita local government dues; it is governed by an elected/appointed Governing Board, which sets policy and direction. Metro Water District staffing is provided by the Atlanta Regional Commission Environmental Planning Division, while plans and policies are guided by the Board Executive and Finance Committees, the Technical Coordinating Committee, and the Basin Advisory Councils (Metro Water District, 2011). 
Similar to the CNG Regional Water Plan, local governments and utilities are responsible for implementing the plans at the local level, and compliance with the plans is directly enforced through the GAEPD’s permitting process. However, while the CNG Regional Water Plan will guide GAEPD’s future permitting decisions, local governments must be in compliance with the District plans to receive a permit for an increased water withdrawal, a new or increased discharge, or for an MS4 permit, with GAEPD being responsible for auditing local governments to determine compliance with the plans, including audit checklists and site visits.

COOSA-NORTH GEORGIA 
In May 2009, the Metro Water District adopted comprehensive updates to the plans the District first adopted in 2003; these long-term WMPs address water supply and water conservation, wastewater management, and watershed management. The Metro Water District plans were referenced extensively during development of the CNG management practices; however, substantial differences remain between the District plans and the CNG Regional Water Plan due to data availability and resolution, resources, and legislative mandate. 
Other Regional Planning Considerations Water Supply Planning Considerations 
Future development of water supplies in the CNG region should take into consideration the availability of water from the Tennessee River basin. A significant portion of the Region is included in the Tennessee River watershed, and local entities should have access to water contributed to the river from watersheds within north Georgia. The CNG Council recognizes there are potential legal issues that would have to be addressed between Georgia and Tennessee to facilitate usage of the Tennessee River; however, the Council would like future planning efforts to address this alternative water source in more detail. 
Additionally, regional reservoir projects should be evaluated to meet both in-stream and off-stream needs within and outside of the CNG region. Portions of the CNG region, specifically in the Coosa basin, have the potential for development of new water supply reservoirs that may provide sufficient yield to supply water to areas outside of the CNG planning area. The CNG Council is not opposed to considering these options for meeting future water supply needs in Georgia; however, the Council would like to ensure that a complete and thorough evaluation is completed to ensure that the CNG basin water resource needs (both in-stream and off-stream) are met. 
Total Maximum Daily Load Implementation 
The State’s TMDL process establishes the allowable pollutant loadings or other quantifiable parameters for a water body based on the relationship between pollutant sources and in-stream water quality conditions. This allows water quality-based controls to be developed to reduce pollution and restore and maintain water quality (GAEPD, 2011). Integration of the CNG Region’s existing TMDL Implementation Plans was an important component considered during the development and selection of the management practices. 
There are approximately 200 stream segments in the Coosa, Tallapoosa or Tennessee River basins covered by a TMDL Implementation Plan, primarily for fecal coliform, impaired biota or fish consumption guidelines/commercial fishing ban due to legacy pollutants such as PCBs or metals. TMDLs for DO have been developed for multiple stream segments in the CNG region, including the Coosa River in Floyd County, the Toccoa and Nottely Rivers, and McFarland Branch in the Tennessee River basin. The DO TMDLs recommend management practices to help reduce 
7-40 

and/or maintain the Ultimate Oxygen Demand loads including water quality monitoring, compliance with the requirements of the NPDES permit program and the application of nonpoint source BMPs. 
There are three Chlorophyll a TMDLs for embayments of Lake Allatoona in the Coosa River Basin (Etowah River, Allatoona Creek and Little River). Studies are also currently under way related to Carters Lake and Lake Lanier. Chlorophyll a is a pigment in algae and is used as an indicator of the potential presence of nutrients in a waterbody that cause excess algal growth. A lake segment is placed on the “not support” list if during the last five-year assessment period, the chlorophyll a growing season (April through October) average exceeds the site-specific criteria two or more times (GAEPD, 2009). The Chlorophyll a TMDL Implementation Plan for the Little River embayment provides an extensive list of regulatory and voluntary practices/control actions (management measures) to reduce pollutants, milestone schedules to show the development of the management measures (measurable milestones), and a monitoring plan to determine the efficiency of the management measures (Atlanta Regional Commission, 2006). In addition, the 2008 nutrient TMDL for Lake Weiss requires a 30 percent reduction in total phosphorus loadings at the state border from the Coosa River basin to meet the 20 ug/L chlorophyll-a standard in the lake. This will require additional point and non point source nutrient loading reductions in the lower Coosa River basin. Implementation of the management practices will assist many CNG local governments and utilities with meeting their TMDL obligations while the Resource Assessments developed for this Regional Water Plan can help inform adaptive management updates to the TMDL Implementation Plans in the future. 
Northwest Georgia Regional Water Resources Partnership 
The Northwest Georgia Regional Water Resources Partnership was formed and endorsed by the Board of Directors of both the Coosa Valley and North Georgia Regional Commissions (known as RDCs at the time) in 2001 in recognition of the importance of watershed planning. Water withdrawal and discharge permit holders (government, water authority, industrial and private communities) and interested entities not holding water permits (governments, quasi governmental agencies, environmental organizations, advocacy groups, and other interested entities) were invited to participate, and an executive committee of 12 members was elected from the membership. Many of the local governments, utilities and industries in the CNG region are full participating members of the Partnership. The goals of the Partnership include: 
Goal 1: Organize and increase our collective political influence on local, state and national levels. 
Goal 2: Combine our resources to develop and implement watershed assessments, water supply studies, and storm water management initiatives within the region including the Coosa, Tallapoosa, and Tennessee River Basins. 
COOSA-NORTH GEORGIA 

Goal 3: Educate legislators, citizens, and ourselves on surface and ground water resources in the region. 
Goal 4: Obtain funding from a variety of sources for water related activities. 
Goal 5: Monitor, assess, and shape local, state, and national legislation on water related issues. 
Goal 6: Monitor the proposed ACT and ACF water compact agreement. 
Goal 7: Serve as a coordinating mechanism for all regional water related activities including development of the proposed State Comprehensive Water Resources Management Plan. 
The Partnership completed a Regional Comprehensive Water Management Plan and an Inventory and Needs Assessment for Water and Wastewater Capacity in 2004 and a Regional Preliminary Reservoir Siting Plan in 2007 (Marlowe, 2010). It is currently preparing a Regional Watershed Assessment / Watershed Protection Plan. 
Lake Allatoona/Upper Etowah River Comprehensive Watershed Study 
The Etowah River watershed above Allatoona Dam includes portions of eight counties: Bartow, Cherokee, Cobb, Dawson, Forsyth, Fulton, Lumpkin, and Pickens. Dawson, Lumpkin and Pickens counties in the CNG region are participating in the Study. In response to the previously defined problems, Congress authorized the USACE to address the water resource problems within the study area. The Lake Allatoona/Upper Etowah River Watershed Study was authorized by Section 422 of the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 (Public Law 106-541) to address streambank and shoreline erosion, sedimentation, water quality, fish and wildlife habitat degradation, and other problems relating to ecosystem restoration and resource protection in the Lake Allatoona Watershed. 
The Study’s general Goals/Value Added include: 
1. 
Develop and implement a technically sound approach to protecting the water resources of the basin that is irrespective of geo-political boundaries. 

2.
 Leverage local, state, and federal funding to maximize benefits for water resources protection and restoration. 

3. 
Build upon and link the valuable efforts of organizations such as the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District, Upper Etowah River Alliance and others 

4. 
Facilitate implementation of a true multi jurisdictional approach to protect and sustain the Lake Allatoona/Upper Etowah River watershed.

The Watershed Assessment and Watershed Protection planning effort are designed to provide the data needed to make targeted improvement in the quality and quantity of water and ecological conditions of Lake Allatoona and the Upper Etowah River Watershed. This information will help county governments as they strive to protect environmental quality and meet or exceed regulatory requirements, while managing rapid growth in North Georgia. (USACE, 2011c).

As detailed below, the Council selected both qualitative and quantitative benchmarks that will be used to assess whether the management practices are closing gaps and eliminating shortages over time and allowing the Region to meet its vision and goals. 
8.1 Benchmarks 
The State Water Plan guided the Council’s selection of benchmarks that are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-phased. Table 8-1 outlines the benchmarks for implementation of this Regional Water Plan; the short-term actions outlined in Tables 7-1(a) through (d) will serve as overall benchmarks, and it recommended that progress be measured via an annual survey. 
While details on administration of the annual survey are pending Regional Water Plan adoption, it is assumed that GAEPD and DCA will coordinate this online measurement tool with the support of the RCs. GAEPD and DCA will track the results of these surveys for needed adaptation and adjustments to the CNG Regional Water Plan during the 5-year update. 
Table 8-1 also provides resource-specific benchmarks that allow a mechanism for tracking realistic and measureable progress over the long-term in addressing the water resource gaps, or issues, described in Section 5. For example, due to the time it takes to develop or expand water and wastewater infrastructure, it is appropriate to measure overall progress during the 5-year Regional Water Plan update cycle by revisiting the infrastructure gaps summarized by County in the tables in Section 5. The resource benchmarks also build on existing measurement tools, such as the biennial update of the Clean Water Act 305(b)/303(d) list of waters not meeting their designated uses.
